AB  - During 1914, the plasmoses of cattle continued to cause enormous losses to stockowners owing to the serious shortage of bulls, the heavy mortality of young animals, more especially of grade stock, and the anaemia and consequent loss of size, vigour and maturity of all bovine animals due directly or indirectly to these diseases. Indigenous cattle are comparatively resistant to the plasmoses, while the mortality 165 of cattle introduced for the purpose of improving the type has proved very great. Attempts to produce immunity against these diseases have met with varying success. It was found that animals bred on dipped areas, when removed to tick-infested veld, contracted redwater and frequently died. Until dipping is universal, its practice is attended by marked disadvantages in limiting the movement of stock born on clean areas. Although redwater yields readily to regular dipping, anaplasmosis is not easily eliminated. Blood, taken from cattle from dipped areas and inoculated into cattle newly arrived from Great Britain, produced a marked anaplasmosis reaction. In one case blood from a nine months old heifer, born and running since birth on an area where five-day dipping had been practised under Government supervision for five years, caused no redwater, but gave rise to a severe anaplasmosis, from which the inoculated animal died. It would appear therefore that the ideal method of dealing with these diseases is to supplement regular dipping with a simple and safe method of protective inoculation. The first series of experiments undertaken to discover a specific therapeutic agent against anaplasmosis was unsuccessful. A second series was conducted to discover and test various strains of virus which would give rise to a mild form of plas-mosis, followed by a marked degree of immunity or tolerance. Twelve imported shorthorn heifers were used for the purpose. A favourable virus was obtained and six of the animals suffered from mild reactions from which they recovered. They were then exposed to natural tick infection, which it is believed they will be able to resist. The virus is now being tested on the remainder of the heifers, and if good results are obtained, the inoculation of imported stock will, in the near future, be carried out more successfully than formerly.

AB  - A technique for cloning T. parva which has been developed by ILRAD scientists is described. Uninfected nymphs of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus are fed on cattle infected with a stock of T. parva. When the nymphs moult to the adult stage they are fed on rabbits for 4 days to induce the maturation of T. parva sporozoites. The ticks are then removed, and their salivary glands are dissected aseptically and ground gently to release the sporozoites. Dilutions of sporozoites are then used to infect lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations of 1 sporozoite/100 lymphocytes. The cell line obtained in this way is then cloned twice using the limiting dilution technique, and cultured to produce sufficient parasites to infect the animal from which the cells were originally taken. Uninfected R. appendiculatus nymphs are applied to these cattle and the resulting infected ticks are ground up to harvest sporozoites, which are tested for infectivity in cattle. The harvested sporozoite population is considered a clone. At each stage in this technique, parasites are isolated and characterized by several methods, including a monoclonal antibody test, DNA probes and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms. When the cloned sporozoite stabilates are shown to infect cattle, they are further characterized using PAGE, Western blotting, cytotoxicity assays, and in vivo infectivity and cross-immunity tests.

AB  - Ixodes ricinus is the commonest tick species in Europe, and transmits Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, rickettsiosis, and babesiosis. The risk of Borrelia burgdorferi infection increases with the time of tick engorgement, but not every infection necessarily causes erythema migrans or Lyme borreliosis. Therefore, the finding of B. burgdorferi DNA in a tick does not prove that the patient will subsequently develop Lyme borreliosis. Ticks should be removed as early as possible with fine tweezers, taking the tick's head with the forceps. Antibiotic prophylactic therapy after a tick bite is not generally recommended. Tick bites can potentially be prevented by covering the body as much as possible or by applying repellents to the body and permethrin to clothes. Tick bite areas should be inspected for 1 month. Lyme borreliosis should be suspected when an erythema at the tick bite site or a febrile illness develop. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Ticks are obligate blood feeding ectoparasites of vertebrates and induce huge production loss in livestock industry and creating serious public health problems in the world. This study was conducted to explore ethnoveterinary practices that are performed by livestock owners to control tick infestation in some districts of North Gondar, Ethiopia and to identify potential herbal materials used to control tick infestation in livestock. Three districts of the zone were selected from each agroecological zone. The data were collected using semi-structured questionnaire and field observation. Sixty randomly selected livestock owners were used as the source of information. Tick infestation is prevalent in all districts. Loss of body condition, disease transmission and damage of skin were the most commonly mentioned effects of tick infestation on the animals. The most commonly used tick control methods were use of acaricides and manual removal, however, use of herbs, washing with soap and cutting with sharp materials were also mentioned by respondents. Nine potential medicinal plants were identified that could be used to kill or repel ticks. In conclusion, tick infestation is the problem in the districts. Livestock owners use different techniques to remove tick from the animals and their effectiveness has to be evaluated.

AB  - Traditional systems account for 95% of the livestock produced in Burkina Faso. Tick infestation hampers livestock productivity in this area. However, little information exists on tick-control practices used by livestock farmers. We interviewed 60 stockbreeders working in traditional farming systems to obtain the first data on tick-control practices. Sixteen farmers (27%) did not use conventional practices: seven removed ticks by hand or plastered cattle with dung or engine oil; nine farmers treated cattle with crop pesticides. Forty-four farmers (73%) used mainly synthetic pyrethroids (SP; either alphacypermethrin or deltamethrin in 20 and 18 farms, respectively) and occasionally amitraz (N=6). Intervals between treatments varied significantly depending on the chemical used: most farmers using crop pesticides (100%), amitraz (100%) or alphacypermethrin (80%) adjusted tick-control to tick-burden, whereas farmers using deltamethrin tended more to follow a tick-control schedule. Perception of tick-control effectiveness significantly varied among practices: tick-control failures were more frequently reported by farmers using alphacypermethrin (55%) than by those using either other conventional acaricides (17%) or crop pesticides (0%). We investigated whether this could indicate actual development of SP-resistance in cattle ticks. First, using the larval packet test technique, we confirmed that the computation of LC 50 and LC 90 was repeatable and remained stable across generations of the Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus) geigyi Hounde laboratory strain. We then collected from the field fully-engorged female R. geigyi to evaluate the SP-resistance relative to the Hounde reference strain. We did not detect any case of SP-resistance in the field-derived R. geigyi ticks.

AB  - Good control of Ixodid ticks that transmit equine piroplasmosis caused by Piroplasma [cabatti] and Nuttallia was obtained in Central Asia by spraying parts of infested horses with a solution of sodium arsenite containing 0.2-0.24 per cent, arsenic trioxide and removing the ticks by hand. Treatment was repeated every six days during the season. Dipping the horses in an arsenical solution was effective, but was abandoned as it led to undue fatigue in the animals at work. Burning the previous year's grass in pastures infested by Hyalomma marginatum, Koch, gave good control.

AB  - This study was undertaken in two different climatic areas of Turkey to determine the presence of tick-borne pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. The ticks were removed from humans, pooled according to species and developmental stages, and analyzed by PCR, reverse line blot (RLB) and sequencing. Of the 2333 removed ticks from 10 species, 1238 (53.06%) were obtained from the arid cold zone, and the remaining 1095 (46.93%) were obtained from the humid zone. The removed ticks were identified as Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma detritum, Hyalomma excavatum, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Haemaphysalis sulcata, Ixodes ricinus, Haemaphysalis and Ixodes spp. nymphs. The dominant species was I. ricinus (61.27%) in the humid zone, whereas the Haemaphysalis spp. nymph dominated (30.29%) in the arid zone. Infection rates were calculated as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Of the 169 pools tested, 49 (28.99%) were found to be infected with the pathogens, and the overall MLE of the infection rate was calculated as 2.44% (CI 1.88-3.17). The MLE of the infection varied among tick species, ranging from 0.85% (CI 0.23-2.34) in Haemaphysalis spp. nymph to 17.93% (CI 6.94-37.91) in D. marginatus. Pathogens identified in ticks included Theileria annulata, Babesia ovis, Babesia crassa, Anaplasma/ Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma ovis, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon felis. Most tick pools were infected with a single pathogen. However, four pools infected with H. canis displayed infections with B. crassa, A. phagocytophilum and E. canis. The sequencing indicated that Anaplasma/ Ehrlichia spp. was 100% identical to the sequence of Ehrlichia sp. Firat 2 and 3 previously identified from Hyalomma anatolicum.

AB  - Five species of ixodid ticks that frequently feed on humans, Ixodes dammini, I. scapularis, I. pacificus I. ricinus, and I. persulcatus, are competent vectors of B. burgdorferi. Collectively, these species are distributed over vast areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. Lyme disease is becoming prevalent because of increased human exposure to infected ticks over large areas will be difficult because none of these species is concentrated in a particular habitat. In relatively small local areas and special habitats such as islands, ticks may be reduced significantly by application of chemicals or by altering the environment.

AB  - Five species of ixodid ticks that frequently feed on humans, Ixodes dammini, I. scapularis, I. pacificus I. ricinus, and I. persulcatus, are competent vectors of B. burgdorferi. Collectively, these species are distributed over vast areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. Lyme disease is becoming prevalent because of increased human exposure to infected ticks. Chemical and environmental methods of controlling these ticks over large areas will be difficult because none of these species is concentrated in a particular habitat. In relatively small local areas and special habitats such as islands, ticks may be reduced significantly by application of chemicals or by altering the environment. For example, areas surrounding homes may be successfully treated with timely applications of chemicals; reductions in ticks may be achieved by eliminating significant host animals, such as deer. Satisfactory biologic methods of control are presently unavailable. Personal protection efforts taken by the individual, such as using repellents on clothing or skin, wearing clothing that prevents ticks from easily gaining access to skin, and locating and removing attached ticks promptly, may be the most effective measures that can be taken to reduce risk of contracting Lyme disease.

AB  - To obtain information on tick paralysis in dogs, including the nature of disease, host signalment, tick-host relationship, treatment, disease progression and recovery, and preventive measures, a prospective survey of 577 dogs affected by tick paralysis was conducted during 1998. Forty-two veterinary clinics along the eastern coast of Australia were instructed to complete survey forms for the first 15 dogs with tick paralysis from September to November. 5% of dogs died from tick paralysis and younger dogs survived more likely. Long coat length was associated with greater tick burden, but not with greater tick size. Coat thickness was not related to these parameters. Dogs with mild disease recovered more quickly from tick paralysis. Respiratory and gait scores reflected disease severity and were good prognostic indicators. The size of the tick did not reflect the severity of the clinical condition it induced in the host. No method of tick removal or in situ treatment improved recovery time or reduced mortality. However, the time spent in hospital was significantly less for dogs from which the live tick was manually removed. Inspiratory stridor, which was evident in some dogs with tick paralysis, was not related to tick attachment on the neck. The use of acepromazine maleate or dexamethasone did not reduce recovery time or mortality. Increasing the dose of tick antitoxin serum (TAS) above 0.1 ml/kg had no effect on mortality or recovery time. Dogs with severe disease that received an additional dose of TAS were significantly less likely to survive. Subcutaneous use of TAS at the site of tick attachment was of no benefit in reducing mortality or time to initial clinical improvement. A registered preventative product had not been used on the majority of dogs. Clipping the coat to search for ticks did not reduce mortality. It is suggested that therapy needs to address cardiopulmonary dysfunction that may be due directly to the effect of tick toxin aside from the respiratory compromise caused by progressive respiratory muscle failure.

AB  - Ticks are parasites which can cause anaemia by sucking blood in different animals in addition to some diseases which are transmitted by them. The identification of ticks in each area is important in the prognosis of the potential presence of a transmitted disease. 5491 animals including 3992 sheep, 695 goats, 426 cattle, 329 camels and 48 stray dogs were used in the study. Three zones of the body including ear, head and below the tail and perianal region and around of mammary glands in females and scrotum in males were inspected. After counting the ticks, they were removed and transmitted to alcohol-glycerin for identification of the genus and species. 6259 ticks were found which included 3 genus and 9 species namely: Rhipicephalus bursa, R. sanguineus, Hyalomma anatolicum excavatum, H. anatolicum anatolicum, H. dromedarii, H. schulzei, H. detritum, H. asiaticum asiaticum and Ornithodoros lahorensis. In the study, R. bursa was found mainly in sheep, goats and dogs, H. anatolicum excavatum in cattle and H. dromedarii in camels. The highest level of infestation of ticks in cattle was concentrated in the east of Garmsar which has the largest number of farms. In sheep and goats, this concentration was located in south of Garmsar while in camels and dogs, the highest number were located at north of the city. Stray dogs as compared to the other animals showed the highest degree of tick infestation (83.33%). The average number of ticks on the animals in Garmsar was found to be <10 and the highest number was observed in goats in the east of Garmsar. The role of R. bursa and R. sanguineus in the transmission of Babesia sp. in cattle, sheep, goats, horses and dogs and the role of Hyalomma sp. in the transmission of Theileria sp. should be studied. Dipping is one of the most important methods for the control of protozoa at one month interval from early spring. Further study of Ornithodorus lahorensis in the transmission of Anaplasma in camels is necessary.

AB  - The tick infesting cattle, horses, buffalos, goats and deer in Guam is indistinguishable from Margaropus caudatus. Cattle in particular are infested throughout the year, the ticks being specially abundant during the dry season. Native cattle, as a result of tick infestation and continuous inbreeding, are weak and undersized. Imported animals become rapidly infected and the resulting fever may cause death at any time, or the animal may continue to live in an emaciated condition. The conditions prevailing in Guam render the eradication of ticks or the enforcement of quarantine regulations extremely difficult. Hand-picking of ticks and the application of oil and kerosene have proved unsatisfactory. The native method, which has proved of some value, is to stand the animal in sea-water for an hour or more, then to scrape the skin to remove ticks and finally to rub in lemon juice. The treatment is repeated two or three times at intervals of from six to eight days. Plans are being made for dipping cattle at regular intervals in order to eradicate ticks. External parasites of poultry in Guam include two species of lice, Menopon pallidum; and Goniocotes gigas, and the mite, Dermanyssus gallinae.

AB  - The genus Rickettsia comprises pathogenic and non pathogenic obligate intracellular bacteria. The main pathogenic species in the New World is Rickettsia rickettsii transmitted by ticks of Amblyomma genus. Apart of R. rickettsii, another riquetsiosis caused by Rickettsia parkeri, with mild symptoms, was recently described in South America. In Brazil clinical cases caused by R. parkeri were notified in Bahia and Sao Paulo. This study was conducted in a spotted fever endemic area in Vila Itoupava, Blumenau, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. This area has a periurban characteristics inserted in fragments of Atlantic rainforest. Blood samples were collected from humans and dogs to be tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) against rickettsial antigens. Ticks removed from dogs were identified and submitted to hemolymph test and shell vial attempting to isolate rickettsiae. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing of rickettsial gene fragments were performed on the rickettsial isolates and also directly on tick samples. Of the 15 human sera 7 were IFA positive (46.68%), with seroreactivity of 26.67%, 26.67%, 20%, 40%, 13.34% and 6.67% for R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, Rickettsia rhipicephali, Rickettsia amblyommii, Rickettsia bellii and Rickettsia felis, respectively. Of the 52 samples collected from dogs 35 were IFA positive (67.31%), with seroreactivity of 50%, 57.70%, 44.23%, 48.08%, 25% and 26.93% for R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. rhipicephali, R. amblyommii, R. bellii and R. felis, respectively. Ticks were collected from 21 (39.62%). Three tick species were identified among 153 specimens collected: 95 Amblyomma ovale, 52 Amblyomma aureolatum and 6 Rhipicephalus sanguineus. After hemolymph and shell vial techniques, R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest was successful isolated from A. ovale and A. aureolatum ticks, and further characterized by DNA sequencing of fragments of the rickettsial genes gltA, ompA, ompB and htrA. Overall, 7.79% of A. ovale and 10% of A. aureolatum ticks were PCR-positive for both gltA and ompA genes. DNA sequences generated from the PCR products of these ticks presented 100% of similarity with R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression (forward selection method) were used when necessary. The unique significant independent variable was "time spent in the forest", being that dogs visiting the forest had up to 19.286 higher chances of being IFA positive for riquettsia than dogs that did not visit the forest. In conclusion, the agent R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest is present in the study area and may be the cause of spotted fever in the area. The independent variable "time spent in the forest" had statistical significance and, according to the results of this research, changing this variable only could reduce up to 19.28 times the chances of a dog being infected with R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest.

AB  - During a study in Oklahoma, an apparatus for infesting cattle with Amblyomma americanum was constructed. An elastic band was attached about the girth of a calf by a pair of leather straps to form a belt. Snap fasteners on the belt held 2-part seamless steel cans, containing the ticks, to the belt. Once the belt was positioned on a calf and the cans were fastened in place, a latex band blocking the exit holes in each can was removed and the ticks crawled on to the host. The belt had no effect on average daily weight gain in preweaner calves but provided a method for infesting calves with A. americanum in numbers similar to those observed in field infestations.

AB  - In the Czech Republic, the incidence of Lyme borreliosis (LB) has shown a rising trend since 1988. The goal of this study has been to find out to what extent a selected part of population is aware of ticks and of the relationship between ticks and LB. The study was based on a questionnaire survey. A total of 110 respondents were selected, including 19 secondary school students, 32 blood donors, 44 park-goers, 15 countryside people. As many as 99% of the respondents were aware of the presence of ticks, 91% knew that ticks are sucking blood of humans and animals, 1.8% thought they eat leaves. 74.5% of the respondents expect ticks to reach them from the vegetation while 22% believe that ticks fall from the trees. Furthermore, 87% and 75% of the respondents indicated to have had ticks attached to the skin or to have removed a tick from other persons' skin, respectively. Only 6.7% of them had never come into contact with ticks. 17% of the respondents use disinfectant when removing a tick, while 67% use oil for tick removal. Almost 30% remove ticks with naked hands. Over 14% destroy the ticks by squashing them with naked fingers. Finally, about 11% of the population studied had never heard about LB and 41% were not aware of the risk of tick-borne encephalitis.

AB  - The incidence of Lyme borreliosis (LB) has a rising trend since 1995. In 1995 6,302 cases were reported, in 1996 4,192 (EPIDAT, SZU). The objective of the present work was to assess in a selected population sample knowledge of ticks and their relationship to Lyme borreliosis. The investigation was based on a survey using questionnaires. 110 respondents were selected according to the following pattern: 19 secondary school students, 32 blood donors, 44 visitors of parks, 15 countryside people. 99.1% of the subjects knew about the existence of ticks in the Czech Republic, 10.9% of the respondents do not know about Lyme borreliosis. More than 80% of the people are in the countryside at least once a week. 87% of the people report they had a tick, 75% removed a tick from another person. Only 6.7% of the respondents never had any contact with ticks. When removing ticks 17% of the subjects use disinfection, 67% use oil. Almost 30% of the respondents remove ticks with bare hands and more than 14% destroy them by squashing them between their fingers. 41% are not aware of the risk of transmission of tick-borne encephalitis. From the investigation a frequent contact of the population with ticks is apparent. Theoretical knowledge of the problem is extensive, practical experience is different. Unfortunately unsuitable habits in removal of ticks persist and this increases the risk of transmission of Lyme borreliosis.

AB  - The seasonal pattern of tick load on Bunaji cattle under traditional management in northern Nigeria was observed over 12 months to investigate the possibilities of strategic use of acaricide. Ticks were removed 2-3 times weekly by hand from 16 animals, counted and the species determined. Tick load was low in the dry season (2-5 ticks per animal per week), increased after the onset of the first scattered rains, reached a peak (40 ticks per animal per week) 1 month after the beginning of the heavy rains, and declined thereafter. The dominant tick species was Amblyomma variegatum; other species found were Boophilus spp., Rhipicephalus spp. and Hyalomma spp. The low level of tick load compared with data from literature and from crossbred (Friesian-Bunaji) cattle kept in the study area suggests high tick resistance in Bunaji cattle. A biologically feasible method of controlling ticks in indigenous cattle would be twice weekly spraying with acaricide during only 2 months of the year in the early wet season to break the pronounced peak in the tick load. However, hand spraying offers no advantage over hand removal of ticks in terms of saving labour. The main advantage of strategic spraying lies in more thorough removal of ticks and possibly prevention of dermatophilosis at a lower cost than year-round use of acaricide. Knowledge of the seasonal pattern of tick load is also valuable for planning the introduction of selected stock with higher genetic potential, but higher susceptibility to tick-borne diseases than exhibited by Bunaji cattle.

AB  - Background: Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States and in Europe. The aim of this study was to examine knowledge, perceived risk, feelings of anxiety, and behavioral responses of the general public in relation to tick bites and LD in the Netherlands. Methods: From a representative Internet panel a random sample was drawn of 550 panel members aged 18years and older (8-15 November 2010) who were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Results: Response rate (362/550, 66%). This study demonstrates that knowledge, level of concern, and perceived efficacy are the main determinants of preventive behavior. 35% (n=125/362) of the respondents reported a good general knowledge of LD. While 95% (n=344/362) perceived LD as severe or very severe, the minority (n=130/362, 36%) perceived their risk of LD to be low. Respondents were more likely to check their skin after being outdoors and remove ticks if necessary, than to wear protective clothing and/or use insect repellent skin products. The percentage of respondents taking preventive measures ranged from 6% for using insect repellent skin products, to 37% for wearing protective clothing. History of tick bites, higher levels of knowledge and moderate/high levels of worry were significant predictors of checking the skin. Significant predictors of wearing protective clothing were being unemployed/retired, higher knowledge levels, higher levels of worry about LD and higher levels of perceived efficacy of wearing protective clothing. Conclusions: Prevention programs targeting tick bites and LD should aim at influencing people's perceptions and increasing their knowledge and perceived efficacy of protective behavior. This can be done by strengthening motivators (e.g. knowledge, concern about LD, perceived efficacy of wearing protective clothing) and removing barriers (e.g. low perceived personal risk, not knowing how to recognize a tick). The challenge is to take our study findings and translate them into appropriate prevention strategies.

AB  - From 1921 to the end of 1941, 253 cases of relapsing fever were reported in California. They occurred in 21 counties, mostly in the easterly mountainous district at elevations of more than 5, 000 ft., but three cases were reported in persons whose sources of infection were situated at less than 1, 000 ft. In field investigations in 1931 and 1932, in the three areas in which cases were known to have occurred in the ten previous years, when the disease was not notifiable, 905 rodents were examined and two strains of the relapsing fever spirochaete were isolated from tamarack squirrels [Sciurus douglasii] and 11 from chipmunks [Eutamias]; a field worker developed relapsing fever six days after contaminating his hands with the blood of an infected tamarack squirrel. Search for the vector in subsequent years showed that the occurrence of many cases in individual cabins, sometimes over a period of years, in resort areas was attributable to transmission by Ornithodoros hermsi, Wheeler, taken into the cabins by rodents nesting there [cf. R.A.E., 23 221; 24 207]. 0. hermsi was later found infected or uninfected in other parts of California at altitudes of more than 5, 000 ft. and it is considered the probable vector of all cases at such altitudes, while 0. parkeri, Cooley, was found associated with one case at 250 ft. [30 130]. O. talaje, Guer., and 0. turicata, Duges, occur in California, but are not known to transmit relapsing fever there. COLEMAN (J. M.) & WRIGHT (H. E.). The present Distribution of Relapsing Fever in Texas (26-28 pp 2 refs. 1 map,) Cases of relapsing fever have been reported intermittently in Texas since 1927 at least. The number of cases recorded in each of the years 1933-41 is given in a table. Incidence is shown to have increased from 1933 to 1937 and then declined progressively. The seasonal trend and geographical distribution of 164 cases that have occurred since 1935 are discussed. The vector, O. turicata, Duges, has been found in all sections of Texas. It occurs in the dust of limestone caverns in the central part of the State where the disease is most prevalent. CLARK (H. C.). Relapsing Fever in Panama (pp. 29-34, 13 refs.). Incidence of relapsing fever in Panama and the Panama Canal Zone is low, according to hospital records, but there are probably more cases among rural native children than the records indicate. Tolerance is apparently gained very early, and the disease is not of great importance. The new-type canvas beds that have almost entirely replaced the immovable board or bamboo beds have done much to clear rural huts of ticks. The first case to be established by microscopic examination occurred in 1905. The local vectors are Ornithodoros talaje, Guer., which feeds on mammals, birds and reptiles, but not readily on man [ cf. R.A.E., 21 284] and 0. venezuelensis, Brumpt, which is considered the chief vector from man or animals to man. Dunn's work on vectors in Panama and Colombia [ cf. 15 158-159, etc.] and literature on the species of spirochaetes concerned [10 173] are reviewed, and experimental animals and the animal reservoir are discussed. Infection has been found in monkeys ( Leontocebus and Cebus), opossums ( Didelphis), armadillos ( Dasypus), Grison canaster, cattle, horses and mules. JOHNSTONE (H. G.). The Taxonomy of the Relapsing Fever Spirochetes (pp. 35-40, 43 refs.). The literature on the classification of relapsing-fever spirochaetes is reviewed, and the opinion is expressed that until enough information is available to clarify the classification, some name agreeable to all, such as Treponema recurrentis, should be adopted; recurrentis has priority over obermeieri. Each strain should be designated by the locality in which it occurs and its specific intermediate host. The morphology of the spirochaetes is discussed. FRANCIS (E.). The Longevity of fasting and non-fasting Ornithodoros turicata and the Survival of Spirochaeta obermeieri within them (pp. 85-38, 2 figs., 4 refs.). Observations made from 1931 to 1938 on naturally infected individuals of Ornithodoros turicata, Duges, collected in caves in Texas [ R.A.E., 27 140] are summarised, and an account is given of further ones made from 1938 until 17th July 1941 when the last tick died. Ticks of the first batch survived a third period of starvation for as long as 3 years and 10 months, ticks of the second batch a third starvation for as long as 2J years, and ticks of the third batch a second starvation of 2 1/2 years, and a third ranging as long as 11/2 years. Eleven ticks lived 5-6 years, seven 6-7 years, eight 7-8 years, four 8-9 years and two 9-10 years. The greatest length of life observed was 9 years, 10 months and 7 days, but the age of the tick at collection was not known and must make the total age at least ten years. Of the 32 ticks that lived five years or longer, 30 were females [ cf. 31 201; 33 187]. Notes are given on the times that elapsed between engorgement, pairing and oviposition, and the length of life after oviposition. WHEELER (C. M.). The Distribution of the Spirochete of California Relapsing Fever within the Body of the Vector, Ornithodoros hermsi (pp. 89-99, 6 figs., 30 refs.). Literature on the development cycle of relapsing-fever spirochaetes in the Arthropod vectors, mainly ticks, is reviewed. Some authors are shown to have believed that the spirochaetes in the tick produce granule forms, which subsequently give rise to a new generation of young spirochaetes, while others thought that the spirochaetes existed as such in the body of the tick and that granules had no part in the life-cycle [ cf. R.A.E., 28 66-67]. The fact that in a large series of experiments on the transmission of Californian relapsing fever, all infections resulted from the bites of naturally infected ticks ( Ornithodoros'hermsi, Wheeler), whether these were fed on white mice, monkeys or man [24 61; 27 131], led to the conclusion that the spirochaetes or some developmental 'stage must be concentrated within the salivary glands of the tick and flow with the saliva into the wound made by its mouth-parts and thence into the peripheral blood. An account is given of a preliminary study undertaken primarily to locate the spirochaetes or some developmental form in the salivary glands, and also to find the process of development and the general distribution of the spirochaetes after ingestion by 0. hermsi. The methods used are described. It was shown that the spirochaetes begin to migrate and penetrate the gut walls of 0. hermsi within three hours of ingestion of infected blood; they invade the body cavity by the third day or possibly earlier; the process of transverse division apparently continues in the gut contents several days after ingestion of the spirochaetes by the tick; from the tenth day, spirochaetes may be found in various muscles of the tick's body as well as in the body cavity; and spirochaetes, recognisable as such, are present in the gut contents up to at least 38 days after the infective meal. Careful search of sections of two ticks found naturally infected and proved infective failed to reveal any recognisable spirochaetes or " infective granules " in any of the body organs. The failure to locate spirochaetes in the salivary glands of ticks known to be infected or infective is discussed. WYNNS (H. L.). The Epidemiology of Relapsing Fever (pp. 100-105, 3 maps, 10 refs.). The first case of tick-borne relapsing fever known to have occurred in the United States was contracted in Texas in 1905, and the disease was later recorded from 13 western States and British Columbia. Reported incidence is greatest in California and Texas. The species of Ornithodoros that have been proved to be vectors in the United States are 0. turicata, Duges, O. hermsi, Wheeler, and 0. parkeri, Cooley; O.tzajje, Guer., is not known to have transmitted the disease to man there, thugh it has been found infected in nature in Arizona [ R.A.E., 29 145; is also 32 195]. Areas of California in which ticks and rodents have been four of infected and associated with cases, and the geographical distribution of cases of relapsing fever in the State according to their sources of infection are shown on maps. Many rodents have been found infected in nature in varions south-western States and Panama. The 253 cases that were reported in California from 1921 to 1941 [cf. 35 200] are analysed according to date of onset, age and sex, methods of diagnosis, number of relapses and type of dwelling occupies Data are also given on incubation period. More than 66 per cent, of the cases occurred in July and August, often sortly after opening a summer cottage. Winter cases are attributed to ticks leaving their winter quarters in rodent nests within cabins and seeking blood-meals. As 164 of the cases occurred in some type of permanent dwelling, it is presumed that rodents nesting in such dwellings provide the ticks with suitable quarters and if the nests are empty the ticks are attracted to the human occupants. Control depends on reduction of the rodent reservoir. BOHLS (S. W.). Public Health Aspects of Relapsing Fever (pp. 125-130, 36 refs.). Literature on'endemic relapsing fever in the United States is reviewed. The prevention or control of sporadic cases of infection acquired through ticks or the tissues of reservoir hosts is considered the most important aspect of the problem of relapsing fever from the public health point of view, but the risk of epidemicity also requires consideration. Control should be directed to ticks, their habitat and food supply. Infected Ornithodoros are always a menace. Infected colonies, even if localized, are foci for possible dissemination to new habitats, and infected hosts may travel to uninfected colonies of ticks. Where colonies of infected ticks inhabit caverns, it would often be advisable to attempt control. It is doubtful whether fumigation could be widely used, but heavy sprays would be effective in some caverns and possibly some burrows. Certain areas in inaccessible districts should be fenced off to exclude hunters and picnickers. Burning of vegetation is likely to be wasteful and ineffective. Where ticks become established about dwellings, dust beneath floors should be liberally sprayed with creosote. Rats and their food and nests should be destroyed. Control in summer cabins and camp sites is difficult, but rodents should be controlled and creosote applied to wood, and beds and bedding should be treated as against bugs [ Cimex]. The usefulness of parasites of ticks is very briefly discussed. The literature on reservoirs is reviewed, and it is also noted that Manteufel in 1908 showed that some strains of relapsing fever could" be transmitted from rat to rat by the louse, Polyplax (Haematopinus) spinulosa, Burm., and Sergent recovered spirochaetes from naturally infected individuals of Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Latr., on dogs [ cf. R.A.E., 24 46, etc.]. Exposure to ticks should be avoided, protective clothing should be worn, and frequent searches should be made for attached ticks and these removed at once. Precautions advisable in the laboratory are discussed, and points requiring further study or attention are indicated.

AB  - This thesis presents a study carried out to determine the status of tick infestation and tick prophylaxis in dogs in the area of Berlin-Brandenburbg, Germany, and to assess tick awareness among dog owners in the area. A total of 392 owners of 441 dogs (332 from Berlin and 109 from Brandenburg) participated in the study, and were asked to collect ticks from their dogs between 1 March 2010 and 31 March 2011. A total of 1728 ticks were collected by the owners from 251 (57%) dogs: Ixodes ricinus (46%), Dermacentor reticulatus (45%), Ixodes hexagonus (9%), and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (<1%). I. ricinus and I. hexagonus were found all over the urban area. The same applied to D. reticulatus, except for one district. The average tick infestation rate was 0.78 ticks/month, with a median of 0.38 ticks/month. Eighty percent of the tick findings corresponded to finding only one tick. The number of ticks found on individual dogs by their owners varied between 1 and 70. Ixodes spp. showed peak activity during May-June, while Dermacentor during September-October. However, tick infestation could be observed throughout the year. For the dogs included in this study, data regarding tick prophylaxis were available for 1195 ticks. About two-thirds of the ticks were collected from dogs that were treated incorrectly or not treated at all. One-third of ticks was collected from dogs that were treated correctly. Of the 251 tick-infested dogs, 64 received no treatment, while 146 were treated with licensed acaricides. The following results were obtained from 124 dogs that were treated with licensed acaricides: 22.6% were treated correctly; in 37.9%, the treatment interval was not maintained for any of the ticks collected; and in 39.5%, the treatment interval was not followed throughout participation in the study. The body areas most commonly infested by ticks were head, neck, chest and limbs. The preferred methods of tick removal were tick nippers and manual removal. Dog-specific characters such as coat length and size were significant predictors of tick infestation ( P<0.05). It is concluded that tick infestation occurs in almost all dogs in the Berlin-Brandenburg area, thus representing a risk for pathogen transmission. Providing dog owners with adequate information regarding ectoparasitic prophylaxis should be included as an important feature in veterinary practice as part of the annual health examination.

AB  - A technique is described for organ culture of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neum. Whole unfed adult ticks with the dorsal integument removed ('backless tick explants') were cultured in enriched Leibovitz' L-15 medium in which they remained active for at least 32 days at 28 deg C and 9 days at 36 deg C. Development of Theileria parva, as demonstrated by methyl green-pyronin staining, occurred in the salivary glands of infected backless tick explants held for 8 days at 28 deg C or 3 days at 36 deg C. Maturation in vitro of T. parva in the explants was compared with that in cultured excised salivary glands. After 3-7 days at 36 deg C, glands from the explants and excised salivary glands showed similar numbers of infected acini per infected tick. However, after 12 days at 28 deg C, the explants showed 20-30 times as many infected acini per infected tick as excised salivary glands (in 2 experiments). No assessment was made of degree of parasite maturity or infectivity. It was concluded that both organ-culture techniques supported development in vitro of the salivary gland stages of T. parva, but that the backless tick explant technique was simpler and gave generally better results than the culture of excised salivary glands.

AB  - There is some evidence that tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) prevalence in ticks, removed from humans, is higher than that in field-collected ticks from the same area. There are two possible explanations: (i) Infected ticks are more active and aggressive and can be found on humans more often. (ii) Some questing ticks are infected with TBEV in a low, undetectable concentration; during tick feeding, virus replicates and reaches the titers that can be detected. The aim of our work was to evaluate both hypotheses. Using unfed adult Ixodes ricinus, we compared three methods of tick infection with TBEV: (i) injection of the virus under the tick's 4th coxa (percoxal method), (ii) injection through anus (rectal method), and (iii) immersion of ticks in virus-containing medium. The percoxal method showed the best results and was used in further experiments. We compared the dynamics of virus reproduction in ticks that remain unfed after inoculation and in partially engorged ticks fed on mice. When ticks fed for 15 h, the titer of the virus increased in 3 log 10PFU/tick since inoculation, while in unfed ticks it did not change. We also studied the reaction on the repellent DEET of uninfected versus TBEV-infected Ixodes ricinus ticks of the physiological age levels III and IV. We investigated ticks movements upwards in the direction of the bait on the cotton tape, impregnated with an increasing concentration of DEET. Obtained data showed that infected ticks were more active and tolerant to DEET. About 70% of the non-infected ticks and only 13% of the infected ticks did not get over the lowest concentration of the repellent (0.1%). Only infected ticks (5.6%) got over 1% concentration of DEET. Ticks of the physiological age level IV from both infected and uninfected groups were the most active and tolerant to the repellent. Both above-mentioned hypotheses were approved and can be used to explain higher virus prevalences in partially engorged ticks than in field-collected ticks.

AB  - Lyme disease is just one of the many tick borne diseases to be encountered within the United States that can affect humans. To the visitor who confines their time to major conurbations the risk of contracting Lyme disease is minimal. However, anyone planning a hiking trip during tick season must take precautions to prevent being bitten and possibly infected. For those of us who live within an endemic area the shower after a days gardening is not just to remove sweat and dirt but also an opportunity to check for, and if necessary remove, any ticks that may have chosen a human host. Fortunately, the liberal use of insecticide around our house combined with one of our cat's single pawed attempt to eliminate the local white-footed mouse population appears to have been effective in reducing the tick count.

AB  - A description is given of a simple device for restraining small mammals such as mice and voles, in which the animals can be kept alive long enough for larval and nymphal ticks to engorge while preventing the removal of the ticks by grooming. The animal is put inside a spring of appropriate dimensions, which is then bent to form a circular runway. Food can easily be introduced. The spring is kept in a plastic basin from which the engorged ticks are recovered; the basin stands in a dish of water to prevent escape. White mice lived for 15 days in the spring cages and Microtus arvalis for 6 days. From two groups of 400-500 unengorged larvae of Ixodes ricinus (L.) on white mice, 180 and 215 engorged larvae were obtained in 4-9 days. Larvae of I. ricinus became infected with Pasteurella (F[rancisella]) tularensis when the host mice were inoculated with the bacterium 3 days after the larvae had been put on them.

AB  - An account is given of the bionomics of Boophilus annulatus, Say, which transmits Piroplasma bigeminum, the causal agent of Texas fever of cattle, much of the information being similar to that already noticed [ R.A.E, B, ii, 102; iv, 2]. This tick is normally only present in the southern United States, where it is thought to be indigenous and is responsible for an estimated annual loss of 8-40 millions. The number of eggs deposited is influenced by the size and degree of engorgement of the female, the maximum among 53 well-engorged individuals collected at various times of the year being 4, 547, and the average 2, 967. Records made during several years indicate that incubation is retarded to some extent by the presence of moisture in the soil beneath the eggs. The longevity of the larvae ranges from a few days under extremely unfavourable temperature conditions to many months, the maximum period recorded being 246 days. Data accumulated from 1906 to 1911 are tabulated, showing that in general the non-parasitic period (from the dropping of the engorged female until the last of its progeny that have not found a host is dead) is shortest for ticks that engorge in May-July and longest for those that do so in September-November, thus illustrating the value of eradication measures in the spring and summer. The length of the parasitic period occupies 21-55 days, complete development occurring on a single host. There are no well defined broods, but from a study of the length of time occupied by the pre-oviposition and the incubation periods during different seasons of the year and the developmental period on suitable hosts, it is apparent that five generations a year are possible in Texas. Observations have shown that a direct relation exists between the condition of cattle and the degree of infestation; ticks attacking animals on maintenance and on fattening rations developed in about the same time, but a greater number reached maturity on the former. The major method of dissemination is through the transport of livestock, though the fact that engorged females placed in hay as it was baled laid eggs that hatched indicates the danger of distribution by means of such commodities. Eggs, larvae and un-engorged females are capable of withstanding considerable periods of submergence and may thus be carried by streams, especially those in flood. Studies on the effect of temperature on the various stages indicate that winter temperatures constitute a dominant factor in restricting the northern distribution of this species; humidity is probably the principal factor limiting its normal occurrence in the south-western United States. Birds, including poultry, feed on the ticks, and predacious insects, particularly ants of the genus Solenopsis, destroy many engorged females and eggs. This tick may be eradicated by several methods involving its starvation on infested areas and elimination from its hosts by pasture rotation or dipping. In laboratory experiments with arsenical dips on ticks removed from the host, it was found that females in different stages of engorgement were equally susceptible, and that less than 1 per cent. of those completely submerged laid viable eggs, while the majority died without ovipositing. The duration of submersion did not influence the percentage of mortality. By applying the solution to various parts of the ticks, it was found that the effect did not vary greatly, and the area of the integument covered appeared to be the dominant factor. An interval of 14 days elapses between the dipping treatments, which are continued for 7-8 months. Tests showed that neither burning the pasture nor ploughing can be relied upon to kill all the ticks in a given area, and though burial of engorged females at depths of 1-3 ins. in different types of soil resulted in a high percentage of mortality, some larvae hatched from buried eggs and migrated to the surface. The addition of sulphur to the food or the water is ineffective in protecting the animals from infestation.

AB  - Objective: To obtain detailed information about the current geographical distribution and incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands and to identify regional differences in the ecological risk factors that might be involved. Design: Retrospective questionnaire study. Setting: All general practitioner's (GP) practices in the Netherlands. Methods: In April 2002, all GPs in the Netherlands were asked to complete a short questionnaire on the number of cases of tick bites and erythema migrans seen in 2001 and the size of their practice. Associations with possible risk factors were determined at the municipal level. Results were compared with the results of a similar study done in 1995. Results: The response of the GPs was 64.5% (4730/7330). Together, all GPs reported seeing approximately 61 000 patients in 2001 with tick bites and 12 000 patients with erythema migrans. The incidence of erythema migrans was estimated at 73 per 100 000 inhabitants. There were obvious risk areas. At the municipal level, tick bites and erythema migrans were positively associated with the area covered by forest, sandy soil, the number of roe deer and tourism. There was a negative association with the degree of urbanization. Increases in tourism in areas with many ticks, new forests in urban regions and an increased number of horses were positively associated with the increase in tick bites and erythema migrans since 1994. Conclusion: The number of patients with tick bites and erythema migrans seen by GPs in the Netherlands has doubled between 1994 and 2001. This increase may be attributed partly to changes in ecological risk factors and human behaviour. The number of cases of Lyme disease may be reduced by giving prophylactic information annually about ticks and ways to remove them, plus additional education of patients about the recognition of erythema migrans.

AB  - The author discusses the calculation of the total cost of Lyme disease through comparison of the cost of treatment and the cost of illness. This is in reply to a previous article [Fix, A.D., Strickland, G.T. and Grant, J. JAMA (1998) 279, 206-210]. Much of the cost of treatment required is indirect, a result of cognitive, psychiatric and neurological impairments from late-stage disease. It is the authors' opinion that poorly-treated Lyme disease is detrimental as a whole and may be more expensive in the long term in terms of mental and physical well being. It is concluded that better studies are required of the outcome of Lyme disease. D.H. Hassler, M. Maiwald and T.N. Petney report on a decrease in reported Lyme disease cases in Northern Baden, Germany, due to increased public awareness as to the removal of ticks. Clinical removal of ticks places no pressure on the body of the tick thus reducing the likelihood of forced regurgitation during which large numbers of Borrelia burgdorferi are expelled from the midgut of the tick into the patient. M.A. Piras, E.M. Porqueddu, P. Porcu and A. Aceti provide their results of a serological survey of adults in Sardinia for Lyme disease. 50 healthy individuals, 55 patients with tick bites and Mediterranean spotted fever virus, 22 patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus, 20 patients with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia and 40 patients with late stage Lyme disease were tested for Lyme disease. The results showed 13 subjects with positive ELISA screening were negative in 10, equivocal in 2, and positive in 1 patient with suspected Lyme disease. In the 14 subjects with equivocal screening results the Western blot was negative in 9, equivocal in 3 and positive in 2. On the 10 IgM-ELISA-positive subjects the Western blot was negative in 6, equivocal in 3 and positive in 1. It is suggested that ELISA is an unsuitable method to define the prevalence of Lyme disease in areas of unknown endemicity. R.E. Anderson discusses the potential threat of malpractice litigation if a physician does not choose to treat a patient who develops Lyme disease at a later date. A.D. Fix and G.T. Strickland, in reply to previous discussion, note that cost benefit analysis cannot be the only measure of appropriate disease management. In some cases prophylaxis may be beneficial, but in others it may be exposing patients unnecessarily to potential risks of antibiotic therapy. In conclusion A.G. Barbour agrees that the fear of litigation can distort medical decision making and low risk of litigation only stands in areas with a high risk of Lyme disease transmission.

AB  - The importance of studies on the diversity of ticks attacking humans resides mostly in the relatively highly-specific tick-pathogen associations. Human tick bites are commonly reported worldwide but removal of ticks from patients is rarely followed by specific identification of the ticks, leaving to some degree of hazard the preventive treatment of possible associated diseases. A total number of 308 ticks were collected between April and June 2010 from 275 human patients who voluntarily presented to a hospital from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The mean intensity of infection was 1.12 + 0.46. Four species of ticks were identified Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis concinna and H. punctata. Ixodes ricinus was the most abundant species feeding on humans in the study area. A brief review of possible associated pathogen is provided.

AB  - Objective: Tick bite have come into prominence increasingly due to transmission of deadly diseases in the last 10 years. The first identified Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever case in Turkey was reported in the year of 2002. The purpose of this study is assessment of demographic, clinical and laboratory data of cases admitted due to tick bite. Material and Methods: Files of cases with complaints of tick bite who were admitted to the Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital Emergency Department were examined retrospectively. Gender, age, contact address with tick, who removed the tick, physical examination and laboratory findings of cases were evaluated. Results: In this study, 66 female (41%), 95 male (59%), a total of 161 cases were evaluated. The mean age of our cases was 6.64.07 years. The most common application was seen in the month of August. Tick bite was most common in the region of the head and neck (32.3%). In 106 of cases (65.8%), it was detected that tick was removed by a health worker. The most frequent clinical finding was redness in the place of the bite. Increase of body temperature was detected in two of the patients. Real time Change Reaction test performed for Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever was positive in one case. Table of disease of Crimean-Congo hemorraghic fever disease developed in no cases. Conclusion: Tick bite cause fear among the people. Data related to tick bite belonging to our region was shared in this study.

AB  - Objective: Tick bite have come into prominence increasingly due to transmission of deadly diseases in the last 10 years. The first identified Crimean- Congo hemorrhagic fever case in Turkey was reported in the year of 2002. The purpose of this study is assesment ofdemographic, clinical and laboratorydata of cases admitted due to tick bite. Material and Methods: Files of cases with complaints of tick bite who were admitted to the Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital Emergency Department were examined retrospectively. Gender, age, contact address with tick, who removed the tick, physical examination and laboratory findings of cases were evaluated. Results: In this study, 66 female (41%), 95 male (59%), a total of 161 cases were evaluated. The mean age of our cases was 6.6±4.07 years. The most common application was seen in the month of August. Tick bite was most common in the region of the head and neck (32.3%). In 106 of cases (65.8%), it was detected that tick was removed by a health worker. The most frequent clinical finding was redness in the place of the bite. Increase of body temperature was detected in two of the patients. Real time Change Reaction test performed for Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever was positive in one case. Table of disease of Crimean-Congo hemorraghic fever disease developed in no cases. Conclusion: Tick bite cause fear among the people. Data related to tick bite belonging to our region was shared in this study. © 2013 by Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society - Available online at www.cocukenfeksiyon.com.

AB  - The only Argasid ticks found in Madagascar are Argas persicus, Oken, and Ornithodorus moubata, Murr., neither of which appears to be of importance in the transmission of diseases of domestic animals. On the other hand there are about ten species of Ixodids, including Amblyomma variegatum, F., Boophilus annulatus decoloratus, Koch, B. annulatus, Say, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Latr. The first two are the most abundant and the most important as vectors of disease, and a brief account is given of their morphology and bionomics. The diseases transmitted by ticks and methods of treating them are discussed. Bovine piroplasmosis, caused by Piroplasma bigeminum, is transmitted by B. annulatus decoloratus; it occurs on the high plateaux, usually in the second half of October and in November, at least two weeks after the hatching of the ticks. Bovine anaplasmosis, caused by Anaplasma marginale, is transmitted by the same tick; it usually occurs during the hot season, although relapses take place in the cold weather on the high plateaux. Piroplasmosis of sheep, caused by Piroplasma (Babesiella) ovis, has only recently been recorded in Madagascar; in Europe it is transmitted by Rhipicephahis bursa, C. & F., but the infected sheep was harbouring B. annulatus decoloratus. Equine piroplasmosis, caused by Piroplasma caballi, has been observed but is rare. Canine piroplasmosis, caused by Piroplasma canis and transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is even more rare. Heartwater, a disease of sheep, goats and cattle caused by Rickettsia ruminantium, and transmitted by A. variegatum, is present practically throughout Madagascar, but particularly in the south; it is less frequent in indigenous sheep than in improved strains. Ulcerous lymphangitis in horses is due to the Preisz-Nocard bacillus, a saprophyte found in soil, manure and the intestines of animals, which may be introduced into the animal through any cutaneous lesion. Ticks, particularly A. variegatum have been shown to play an important part in the transmission of the infection, which is distributed throughout the Island and is one of the obstacles preventing the successful rearing of horses. The measures recommended for the control of ticks are bush fires, dipping and rotation of pastures. Burning should be carried out at the beginning of the hot season, when the ticks hatch in their largest numbers. This method does not, however, affect ticks on their hosts or eggs buried in the soil. Sodium arsenite dips give the most satisfactory results, but unfortunately the number of dipping tanks in the Island is small. B. annulatus decoloratus, which spends 3-4 weeks on its host and 8 months off it, should theoretically be controlled in 8 months by dipping at intervals of 3 weeks, provided that ticks are removed from the ears (which are not reached by the dip) and that the animals are kept in an enclosed pasture from which infested animals are excluded. In the case of A. variegatum which remains 4-5 days on its first two hosts (in its larval and nymphal stages) and about 12 days on its third host (in the adult stage), dipping should be carried out every 4 days, and as the period off its hosts is longer than in the case of B. annulatus decoloratus, the dippings must be continued for a longer period. In Madagascar dipping is most usually carried out at intervals of 7 days with dilutions of 1: 200 or 1: 250, and satisfactory results are obtained. Under normal conditions, once a tank of dip is prepared, it will last for more than a year; it is renewed when it is dirty or when it has undergone chemical change, such as oxidation, which produces arsenate toxic to cattle; a dip that is regularly used for cattle does not undergo such oxidation. The rotation of pastures necessitates enclosed fields and cannot be widely adopted in Madagascar.

AB  - Because the incidence of spotted fever is increasing in South Carolina, campaigns were carried out in 1973 and 1974 to provide the public and medical practitioners, through pamphlets and news media, with information about spotted fever and the ticks that transmit the causative agent (Rickettsia rickettsi). People were also invited to save and submit live ticks removed from vegetation, animals and man for examination by the haemolymph test. A total of 1186 ticks comprising 987 examples of Dermacentor variabilis (Say), 103 of Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latr.), and 96 of Amblyomma americanum (L.) were examined. Rickettsiae identified by direct immunofluorescence as members of the spotted fever group were detected in 49 (4.9%) of the examples of D. variabilis, and 16 (16.6%) of those of A. americanum. Two hundred and twenty of the ticks (199 of D. variabilis, 17 of A. americanum and 4 of H. sanguineus) were recorded as having been attached to 199 persons. Nine of these ticks (8 of D. variabilis and 1 of A. americanum) were positive by the haemolymph test for rickettsiae of the spotted fever group. Infected ticks were collected from each of the three major South Carolina biogeographical regions: piedmont, sandhill and coastal plain. Since education is the first and most important step in preventing spotted fever, educational programmes and tick examination services similar to those described are suggested for other states that have a high incidence of spotted fever.

AB  - The first technique for repeatedly sampling individual Ixodes scapularis adult ticks was developed and validated. Gut samples from the same individual ticks were removed and analysed at weekly intervals. Multiple analyses were conducted on each gut sample (e.g., total protein concentration, presence of viable B. burgdorferi spirochetes, and concentration of outer surface protein A [OspA]). Female I. scapularis survived for up to 25 d after gut sampling. Seventy-five percent of females oviposited after the sampling procedure, with 14% of ticks laying >1,500 eggs. No significant differences in either fecundity or length of survival were found between B. burgdorferi-infected and uninfected I. scapularis. This technique will enable longitudinal studies on both tick-pathogen interactions and physiological studies that have hitherto not been attempted.

AB  - This paper gives a general account of the economic importance, hosts, geographical distribution, life history, seasonal incidence and probable methods of control of the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus in Britain. The suggested methods of control in ascending order of importance are: -(1) burning of infested pasture and moorland, (2) drainage and liming of marshy ground on which the sheep tick abounds, (3) starvation of the tick by removal of stock for a year or more from infested pasture, and (4) dipping of infested live-stock with efficient acaricides. At the present stage of our knowledge the dipping method is the one which offers most protection to sheep. Dipping, to be effective, must be undertaken at the seasons of the year when the ticks display their greatest activity on the sheep. For a Border farm the following schedule of dipping is recommended: -(1) (barren ewes) three weeks before lambing, (2) entire flock a day or two before lambing begins, (8) unlambed ewes and barren ewes three weeks after the beginning of lambing (ewes with lambs at foot should also be dipped if possible), and (4) entire stock six weeks after the beginning of lambing. The autumn incidence is often so slight as to be practically negligible.-W. MOORE.

AB  - Objective: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes a severe disease in humans, with a mortality of up to 30%. The geographical environment of our country is suitable for ticks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical, and laboratory characteristics of children admitted for tick bites and determine the species of tick removed from the children. Material and Methods: Between April 2009 and September 2009, a total of 104 cases who had tick bites were included in the study. Detailed demographic, laboratory and clinical data were prospectively collected for each patient using a standardized questionnaire. Results: During the study period, a total of 104 children were admitted for tick bite. The mean age of patients was 7.3±4.4 years (1-18 years) and 71% were female. Most of the children (58%) were living in the rural region of Bursa. Of the 104 reported tick bites, most were nymphs of Rhipicephalus spp (42.3%) and larvae of Rhipicephalus spp (22.1%). Larvae of Ixodes spp (8.6%), nymphs of Ixodes spp. (6.7%), nymphs of Hyalomma spp. (4.8%) and adults of H. marginatum (2.7%) and R . sanguineus (10.5%) were also recorded. The records of H. aegyptium (0.9%) and R. turanicus (0.9%) were unremarkable. Clinical findings were normal on admission and follow up. The levels of liver enzymes, creatinine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, bleeding markers and complete blood count were normal. No CCHF infection was detected among the children admitted for tick bite. Conclusion: Tick bites and CCHF are important public health problems and it is crucial to publish information on tick bite prevention, which would play an important role in reducing the incidence of direct parasitic contact and the occurrence of transmittable diseases.

AB  - Among the zoonotic agents causing occupational diseases, those transmitted by ticks are very important, in particular the spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi which are the common cause of occupational Lyme borreliosis in forestry and agricultural workers. The objective of this study was an evaluation of the exposure of forestry workers employed at individual workplaces to infection with tick-borne pathogens (especially Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes), based on epidemiological investigation and serologic tests. Epidemiological studies covered 111 forestry employees from eastern Poland employed in 4 randomly-selected forest inspectorates which replied to questions in the area of epidemiology and prophylaxis of diseases transmitted by ticks. Eighty-two forestry workers employed in one forest inspectorate were examined for the presence of specific anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. The correlation between individual items of the questionnaire was assessed by Spearman's test. Results of serological tests were assessed by Mann-Whitney test. Statistical analysis of the results indicated that the workers performing manual jobs in the forest are at the greatest risk of tick bite and contraction of tick-borne disease. They are aware of the risk, but use the improper method of removal of ticks with the fingers. Comparisons of the relationship between job category and the results of serologic study, expressed in BBU/ml, revealed that the serologic response was significantly greater in manual workers than in administrative workers (p=0.019). All other comparisons did not produce significant results. Therefore, providing a simple tweezer-like device to forest inspectorates seems to be an effective mean of protection against Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases.

AB  - The methods used to test acaricides for the control of Dermacentor variabilis (Say), on Long Island in 1945 and 1946 [ R.A.E., B 35 129; 37 204] were not precise enough for comparison of dosages and formulations. Two spray-towers for this purpose are described. Both involve the use of " tick corrals ", each of which has a wire-screen base and consists of three concentric enclosures of wire screen, with diameters of 1, 3 and 5 ins. and fences 3/8, 5/8 and If ins. high, respectively. The ticks are put in the central enclosure and it takes longer for them to climb all the fences than for the spray to settle, so that all are equally and fully exposed to the spray. The first tower was made by centering a stove pipe over a hole in the top of a drum in which a corral was placed on a wire support. A glass slide with an oleophobic surface was put under it to test the uniformity of the deposit. The spray solution was atomised into the top of the stove pipe and allowed to settle for two minutes, after which the corral was removed and the ticks were transferred to tubes containing moist sand and dry straws. A very uniform deposit was generally obtained. The second tower was a shower-bath stall with walls 7 ft. high and 4 ft. wide and a foot of space between the top of the walls and the ceiling. Five corrals with a slide under each were put on the floor for each experiment, and two minutes were allowed for the spray to settle. Data from one of these tests is given in detail, with photographs of the slides. A 2 per cent, solution of gamma BHC in fuel oil was used and killed 42, 64, 100 and 100 per cent, of the ticks when applied at rates of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 cc. per sq. yard. An application of 2 cc. per sq. yard is equivalent to about 2.5 U.S. gals, [or 0.4 Ib. y BHC] per acre. Deposit patterns were uniform for the different replicates of each experiment, and deposits were clearly correlated with kills. A comparison of the results of several such tests showed that there were no significant differences in original mortality figures between 2 per cent, gamma BHC, 2 per cent, aerosol-grade DDT end 2 per cent, technical DDT at 1.25 U.S. gals. per acre. Semi-field tests made with DDT in 1947 under cages covering one square yard of grass and stocked with 100-400 ticks showed no significant differences in the results given by solutions, emulsions of solutions, suspensions and dusts, and emulsions were chosen for the field tests as they have practical advantages. In 17 experiments of spraying of roadsides and paths [ cf. 29 137] in 1948, DDT was applied at 1.5-5 Ib. per acre, BHC at 0-09-1 Ib.gamma isomer and chlordane at 2.75 Ib. The lowest dosage of DDT immediately reduced populations almost to zero but allowed them to increase to as much as half their former size in ten days. After a second application at the same rate, populations again fell almost to zero and remained very low for the rest of the season. One spraying with 5 Ib. per acre was found in 1949 to be as effective as two with 1.5 Ib. Chlordane and BHC at the highest dosages were less effective than DDT, both in immediate and lasting action. A test on a regional scale was made in 1949 on an island with an area of 11-5 sq. miles. The specially designed apparatus consisted of a tank with a capacity of 42 U.S. gals, mounted on a jeep and having a compressor adjusted to maintain an air pressure of 40 Ib. per sq. inch. Spray was delivered through flat-spraying nozzles on four booms (three rigid and one adapted for spot treatment), each of which could be operated independently. The whole width of a narrow grass-grown roadway could be sprayed at once or each edge of a wider road in turn. The jeep was driven at 10 miles per hour to give a dosage of 9-6 U.S. gals, containing 4.3 Ib. DDT per acre. All accessible roadways and grassy tracks were sprayed, except on one estate that had been recently burned over and was mostly free from ticks. One complete treatment was applied between 30th May and 15th June and a second between 19th and 26th August. It is doubtful whether the second application was necessary as the drop in population that followed it coincided with the normal seasonal decline. Results were assessed by dragging weekly in areas known to be heavily infested at the outset. The average number of ticks found per 1, 000 yards throughout' the season was 10.1 as compared with 56.5 in similar control areas. In four sectors in which 200, 30, 155 and 80 ticks were taken at the last observation before treatment, 0, 1, 35 and 2 were taken, respectively, at the first observation after spraying and numbers did not rise substantially during the next 8-10 weeks. The results were similar to those obtained in the previous year in small sectors carefully treated individually with hand equipment. It is concluded that satisfactory control of D. variabilis on Long Island on either a local or a regional scale could be obtained with the methods described. Specific recommendations based on the findings are appended.

AB  - Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an endemic tickborne disease found throughout the United States and other regions of the world. Exposure may result in a spectrum of disease from subclinical infection to severe or fatal multiorgan collapse. The disease is maintained in nature in Ixodid tick vectors and their hosts. The most important ticks in the United States are Dermacentor variabilis and Dermacentor andersoni. Small mammals are the natural reservoirs in the wild. Dogs become infected when a tick harboring Rickettsia rickettsii feeds on the dog. Dogs do not develop sufficient rickettsemia to act as a reservoir in the transmission of Rickettsia rickettsii. Thus, although dogs act as sentinels to the presence of the disease, they cannot directly transmit infection. Signs in early stages of disease often are nonspecific. The most characteristic laboratory abnormality is thrombocytopenia, but serologic testing is necessary for confirmation of infection. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are effective antibiotics to treat infection. Treatment should continue for 14 to 21 days to allow host immune defenses to develop and eradicate the organism. Prevention requires avoidance of tick-infested areas and rapid removal of ticks should exposure occur. [References: 47]

AB  - This bulletin has been prepared largely from the literature in response to a general demand for information regarding the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor venmtus, Banks ( andersoni, Stiles). The distribution, life-history, seasonal history, habits and host relations of the tick and the part played by it in the transmission of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularaemia and tick paralysis in man, and tularaemia and tick paralysis in domestic animals are discussed. Notes are given on the distribution, host relations and disease-carrying ability of D. albipictus, Pack., D. variabilis, Say, and Haemaphysalis leporis-pahtstris, Pack., and on the seasonal history of the last two; some other ticks of less importance in Montana are also mentioned. Methods of removing attached ticks and types of clothing that minimize liability to infestation are briefly described. The various methods for controlling the tick, such as dipping, pasture rotation, rodent poisoning, and the use of parasites are discussed.

AB  - Lyme disease and the use of tick repellents and physical protective measures to prevent the disease are discussed. Lyme disease is a multiple-organ-system, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder transmitted by the bites of ixodid ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. An individual is at greatest risk for infection when a tick has been attached to the skin for more than 24 hours. Lyme disease occurs in three stages and may affect the skin, nervous system, cardiac system, and joints. Antimicrobials used in management consist primarily of penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, and erythromycin. Tick repellents are divided into those applied to the skin and those applied to clothing. Skin repellents include N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, and dimethyl phthalate. Permethrin is by far the most effective clothing repellent. DEET plus a permethrin-containing clothing repellent offers the best overall protection. The adverse effects of repellents are minimal, but cases of hypersensitivity have been reported, especially in children. Physical measures to prevent tick bites include avoiding tick-infested areas, wearing light-colored clothing for easy identification of crawling ticks, regularly checking the body and pets for ticks, wearing protective garments and closed-toed shoes, and removing attached ticks promptly by using tweezers or forceps to apply a steady upward pull. A vaccine for the active immunization of humans against Lyme disease remains to be developed. Although antimicrobial therapy is available for persons with Lyme disease, the best approach for those who may be exposed to infected ticks is to apply topical skin or clothing repellents and to practice common-sense measures of physical protection.

AB  - The vectorial competence of the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus is discussed in relation to the epidemiology of canine visceral leishmaniasis, taking into account its strict association with dogs and the low indices of natural infection presented by its known vector, the phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania chagasi and the infectivity of these parasites in the tick, 39 specimens (6 females, 11 males and 22 nymphs) of R. sanguineus were removed from 21 dogs showing diverse symptoms of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL). Six ticks (15.4%) gave positive results for the genus Leishmania using the PCR technique. To determine the infectivity of the parasites, 36 hamsters were inoculated orally and peritoneally with macerates of ticks removed from nine dogs symptomatic for visceral leishmaniasis. After 6 months the hamsters were sacrificed and necropsied. Serum was removed for IFAT, as well as spleen and liver fragments to make imprint smears and for PCR. Eight (88.9%) of these dogs presented ticks that were infective for 14 hamsters (41.2%), 12 (85.7%) of them infected peritoneally and two (14.3%) orally. PCR revealed 27 smears (40.9%) to be positive, 20 (62.5%) of them infected peritoneally and seven (20.6%) orally. IFAT showed 14 positive animals (41.2%). Based on these findings, we suggest that the vectorial capacity of R. sanguineus for L. chagasi should be evaluated further, opening new perspectives in the epidemiology of ZVL.

AB  - Two studies were performed to elucidate the current distribution of the tick Dermacentor reticulatus in Germany. In the first study (March-May 2003), 365 dogs from 171 sites in Berlin and Brandenburg were screened for ticks, and the corresponding outdoor sites that the dogs usually visited were searched for host-seeking ticks using the flagging method. 1155 ticks were removed from the dogs. The majority were Ixodes ricinus (88.5%), followed by D. reticulatus (9.1%) and I. hexagonus (2.4%). Altogether, 222 dogs carried I. ricinus (60.8%), 41 D. reticulatus (11.2%) and 15 I. hexagonus (4.1%). Based on scutal index determination, the removed I. ricinus and D. reticulatus had been feeding on the dogs for a mean of 4.0 and 4.5 days, respectively. The dogs infested with D. reticulatus lived at 26 different sites, all previously unknown as Dermacentor sites. Seven of the sites could be confirmed subsequently by flagging the vegetation for ticks. In the second study, 721 deer were shot at 201 different sites from 160 districts all over Germany during the autumn hunting season of 2004. A total of 23 deer (3.2%) originating from 14 sites were infested with D. reticulatus. Significantly more red deer ( Cervus elaphus elaphus) than roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus) or fallow deer ( Dama dama) harboured D. reticulatus ticks. Only 2 of the sites found had already been known as D. reticulatus areas, whereas all other sites in Brandenburg, Saxony Anhalt, Hesse and Bavaria had been unknown. The results of both studies indicated that D. reticulatus presently occurred at far more sites than previously known in Germany and thus most likely had expanded its range. In addition, 135 D. reticulatus removed from deer were screened for Babesia canis and Rickettsia sp. using PCR. 31 D. reticulatus (23%) were positive for Rickettsia. Sequencing revealed in all cases a 100% identity with the strain RpA4 that was first isolated from Rhipicephalus ticks in Russia.

AB  - This book consists of 28 chapters on different topics by various authors; in an introductory chapter the term southern Africa is defined in Wellington's sense to include the whole of Africa south of the South Equatorial Divide (the watershed between the Congo and Zambezi drainages) and prolongations of it eastwards and westwards. Five of the chapters deal in whole or in part with arthropods of medical or veterinary importance. Population genetic studies in areas of overlap of two subspecies of Musca domestica L. (pp. 244-254, 2 figs., 12 refs.), by H. E. PATERSON, contains the results of a study of factors influencing gene-flow between sympatric populations of Musca domestica calleva Wlk. and M. d. curviforceps Sacca & Rivosecchi, two subspecies of M. domestica L. indigenous to South Africa, where they occur mainly outdoors and indoors, respectively [ R.A.E., B 52 75]. As the two subspecies share breeding grounds and these are in feral habitats, insemination of females of M. d. curviforceps by males of M. d. calleva is commoner than the reverse. In spite of the free exchange of genes, stable distinguishable domestic and feral populations coexist in areas in which secondary intergradation occurs. This is thought to be due largely to the isolating effect of habitat preferences and partly also to a behavioural isolating mechanism. In Ecogcographical aspects of tick distribution (pp. 284-300, 2 graphs, 25 refs.), G. THEILER relates the distribution of ticks in South Africa to rainfall and vegetation zones and compares the findings with those in other parts of Africa. The immediate environmental influences that determine the presence or absence of a certain species of tick, such as the microclimate (which is related to the plants that are present in the different areas), are reviewed, as well as the relations between the ticks and their hosts. Control of cattle ticks by ecological means is discussed, and it is concluded that attempts to eliminate ticks by removing all possible alternative hosts are impracticable and that, with the present ranching methods used in South Africa, the vegetation cover cannot be altered by veld management to a degree sufficient to eradicate ticks. In Ecology of wild rodent plague (pp. 301-314, 3 figs., 23 refs.), D. H. S. DAVIS outlines the history of the spread of plague in southern Africa from the introduction of the disease during the early years of the present century in plague-infested rats to 1961, through an early murine phase in which outbreaks were confined to urban areas and its transfer to indigenous wild rodents (the sylvatic phase), and reviews early research on the latter, defines the two factors of greatest importance in limiting plague to rodents occurring in the steppe and semi-desert parts of the region (the topographical barrier, presented by the great escarpment cutting off the elevated plateau that forms the greater part of southern Africa from the narrow coastal belt, and the 25-in. isohyet) and traces the course of an epizootic in wild rodents in a hyperenzootic area in the high veld of the Orange Free State. Discontinuous distribution of the gerbil flea, Xenopsylla philoxera in southern Africa (pp. 315-331, 4 figs., 20 refs.), by R. R. INNES, is a discussion of anomalies, attributed to past climatic changes, in the distribution of Xenopsylla philoxera Hopk. in southern Africa. This flea is an important vector of wild-rodent plague, and is largely restricted to two species of Tatera that act as reservoirs. In The oestroid flies of Africa south of the Sahara, their classification, biology and practical importance (pp. 341-352, 2 figs., 19 refs.), F. ZUMPT assesses the medical and veterinary importance in Africa south of the Sahara of the myiasis-producing Oestrid flies the larvae of which develop in the stomach or head cavities or under the skin of various mammals and lists the species known to occur in the region, with indications of their hosts. The species infesting antelopes, elephants and Perissodactyla do not generally parasitize domestic animals or man, but zebras form a natural reservoir of several species of Gasterophilus that infest domestic Equids, and species of Gedoelstia that have wildebeest ( Connochaetes taurinus) and hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus) as natural hosts, but are not pathogenic to them, cause considerable mortality amongst sheep and other domestic animals and may accidentally infest man.

AB  - This review article summarizes the ectoparasitic diseases likely to be seen by a Western dermatologist. The article aims to cover both endemic diseases and those likely to present in the returning traveler. Tungiasis is due to the gravid sand flea (Tunga penetrans) embedding into the stratum corneum of a human host. As the flea is a ground dweller, lesions are usually present on the feet and are classically periungual. The sand flea is eventually shed spontaneously but to reduce the infection risk, early surgical removal is recommended. Infestation by the Diptera species of fly causes myiasis, which may be primary, secondary, or accidental. The botfly (Dermatobia hominis) is one of the causes of primary myiasis covered in this article. Traditionally, botfly larvae are forced to partially emerge by occluding the breathing apparatus, following which manual extraction can occur. Alternatively, the larvae can be surgically removed. The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) has experienced a resurgence over the past 10 years. Bites are typically arranged in clusters or a linear fashion and vary from urticated wheals to hemorrhagic blisters. Treatment is symptomatic with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. In addition, bed bugs need to be eradicated from furniture and soft furnishings. Ticks are part of the Arachnid class of joint-legged animals and can transmit a variety of infections. This article briefly discusses Mediterranean spotted fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease as well as describing tick avoidance measures. Scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis) is highly contagious and widely distributed around the world. It is common in the returning traveler and can require a high index of suspicion to diagnose. The treatment of choice in the US, UK, and Australia is permethrin 5% dermal cream, applied on two occasions, 1 week apart.

AB  - Chemical and mechanical methods of removing Ixodes ricinus (L.) attached to the skin of pigs and sheep were tested experimentally. Three frequently advocated chemical treatments (gasoline, fingernail polish, and methylated spirit) failed to induce self-detachment of the ticks within 30 min. Also, the success of the subsequent mechanical removal was not influenced by chemical treatment. Two methods of mechanical removal of the ticks also were compared: (1) pulling straight out with a blunt forceps and (2) rotation of the tick around its body axis, using a "Tick Solution" forceps (Instruments of Sweden, Stamford, CT). Pulling frequently resulted in the complete removal of the tick, but fragments of the mouthparts that remained in the skin were often quite large. In contrast, if the tick was removed by rotation without pulling, the tip of the hypostome usually broke off and remained in the skin, but this portion was generally quite small.

AB  - Background: Lyme borreliosis (LB) caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. Data on the distribution and on risk factors in Germany are sketchy. Methodology/Principal Findings: Blood samples of a nationwide population-based cross-sectional study from 2003-2006 in children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years in Germany (KiGGS) were analysed (n=12,614) to assess the seroprevalence of anti- Borrelia antibodies. Data from standardized interviews were used to assess potential risk factors. First, sera were screened for anti- Borrelia antibodies by ELISA. The overall prevalence was 4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.3-5.4%). Positive and borderline ELISA test results were confirmed by a line blot revealing a combined prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI 3.6-4.5%). Seroprevalence of ELISA was significantly higher in males (odds ratio (OR)=1.37; CI 1.15-1.63) and in the southern part of Germany (OR=1.41; CI 1.09-1.83), but significantly lower in children and adolescents with migration background (OR=0.33; CI 0.24-0.44). Study participants from households with cats had a higher chance of seropositivity (OR=6.7; CI 5.6-8.0). In a multivariable model the odds of seropositivity increases by 11% for every year of age for boys and 6% for girls. Conclusions/Significance: This survey is the first nationwide, representative seroprevalence survey of LB in children and young adolescents. The study shows that infections with Borrelia burgdorferi are endemic in all parts of Germany despite regional differences. Even at a young age children are exposed to tick bites including seropositivity. Encouraging a thorough check for ticks and promptly removal of ticks are the key public health strategies to reduce the risk of LB and other tick-borne diseases in children and adolescents. Further epidemiological studies are warranted to better understand the burden of disease related to LB.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain detailed information about the current geographical distribution and incidence of tick bites and Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands and to identify regional differences in the ecological risk factors that might be involved.
DESIGN: Retrospective questionnaire study.
SETTING: All Dutch general practitioner's (GP) practices.
METHODS: In April 2002, all GPs in the Netherlands were asked to complete a short questionnaire on the number of cases of tick bites and erythema migrans seen in 2001 and the size of their practice. Associations with possible risk factors were determined at the municipal level. Results were compared with the results of a similar study done in 1995.
RESULTS: The response of the GPs was 64.5% (4730/7330). Together, all GPs reported seeing approximately 61,000 patients in 2001 with tick bites and 12,000 patients with erythema migrans. The incidence of erythema migrans was estimated at 73 per 100,000 inhabitants. There were obvious risk areas. At the municipal level, tick bites and erythema migrans were positively associated with the area covered by forest, sandy soil, the number of roe deer and tourism. There was a negative association with the degree of urbanisation. Increases in tourism in areas with many ticks, new forests in urban regions and an increased number of horses were positively associated with the increase in tick bites and erythema migrans since 1994.
CONCLUSION: The number of patients with tick bites and erythema migrans seen by GPs in the Netherlands had doubled between 1994 and 2001. This increase may be attributed partly to changes in ecological risk factors and human behaviour. The number of cases of Lyme borreliosis may be reduced by giving prophylactic information annually about ticks and ways to remove them, plus additional education of patients about the recognition of erythema migrans.

AB  - Background: To describe detailed epidemiological analysis of an outbreak of suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) based on available clinicopathological and verbal autopsy findings of the cases and epidemiological intervention taken for prevention and control of the same in a rural setting of India. Aims: To define clinical syndrome, to find-out probable etiology, source of infection, mode of transmission and to develop a control and prevention strategy to halt further spread of unknown fatal febrile illness. Settings and Design: It was an outbreak investigation in affected small village of Gujarat, applying few principles of descriptive epidemiology in rural settings. Materials and Methods: Various information obtained by in-depth interviews, verbal autopsy tools, available medical records and house to house active case finding survey. Statistical Analysis: Microsoft Excel 2007 was used for statistical analysis. Results: The relevant information revealed that it as clustering of unknown hemorrhagic fever in households infested by hard tick population with a potential to further outbreak in and around nearby area. All secondary cases had strong epidemiological link with the index case. The illness was characterized by high grade fever with chills, headache and body-ache for short duration of 3-6 days followed by varying degree of hemorrhagic tendency, hepatic and renal involvement. The case fatality rate was very high (60%) and probable length of the incubation period was 9-15 days. Conclusions: It was a probable outbreak of a viral hemorrhagic fever, clinically compatible with CCHF cases. Effective removal of hard tick population from the village by Malathion spray had played a significant role in control and prevention of further cases.

AB  - Tick paralysis (TP) is a neurotoxic poisoning primarily afflicting young girls in endemic regions. Recent case series of TP have described increasing misdiagnoses of TP as the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). A meta-analysis of the scientific literature was conducted using Internet search engines to assess the evolving epidemiology of TP. Fifty well-documented cases of TP were analyzed over the period 1946-2006. Cases were stratified by demographics, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. Misdiagnoses were subjected to Yates-corrected chi-square analyses to detect statistically significant differences in proportions of misdiagnoses between earlier and later reporting periods. TP occurred seasonally and sporadically in individuals and in clusters of children and adults of both sexes in urban and rural locations. The case fatality rate (CFR) for TP was 6.0% over 60 years. The proportion of misdiagnoses of TP as GBS was significantly greater (chi(2) = 7.850, P = 0.005) in more recently collected series of TP cases, 1992-2006, than the proportion of misdiagnoses in earlier series, 1946-1996. TP was a potentially lethal poisoning that occurred in children and adults in a seasonally and regionally predictable fashion. TP was increasingly misdiagnosed as GBS during more recent reporting periods. Such misdiagnoses often directed unnecessary therapies such as central venous plasmapheresis with intravenous immunoglobulin G, delayed correct diagnosis, and tick removal, and could have increased CFRs. TP should be added to and quickly excluded from the differential diagnoses of acute ataxia and ascending flaccid paralysis, especially in children living in TP-endemic regions of the USA.

AB  - When adult R. appendiculatus were immobilized in paraffin wax and the cuticle and gut removed, it was possible to fix and stain the salivary glands without removing them from the tick and thus detect T. parva-infected salivary gland acini using a dissection microscope. Staining with MGP (aqueous methyl green, aqueous Pyronin Y and acetate buffer) stained the cytoplasm of infected cells blue. Fixation before staining was found not to be necessary. A technique for the selection of heavily infected salivary glands was developed, in which up to 100 ticks were mounted in a Petri dish. A small piece of salivary gland was removed from each tick and stained with MGP. Heavily infected glands were then taken from the ticks for experimental use.

AB  - We present the case of a 33 year-old man from a village of the north-eastern part of central Anatolia admitted to the otolaryngology department of Yeditepe University Hospital with right facial asymmetry and pain on the right ear. A tick of the genus Hyalomma was observed in the external auditory canal of the right ear and it was removed with fine cup forceps under otomicroscopy. We are of the opinion that in patients presenting with sudden acute ear pain and facial palsy, the ear canal should be examined to exclude an infestation by ticks.

AB  - In the 2000 and 2001 years, there was performed a study which has given some insight on the knowledge of youths about ticks and tick-borne diseases. Two thousand seven hundred and sixty-three respondents from 6 to 26 years of age took part in this investigation. More than 98% of respondents knew about the existence of ticks. Almost 93% of children and 97% of adolescents reported that ticks feed on blood. Although the majority of respondents aged 10 to 26 years is convinced that ticks live on vegetation, 23% of them supposed that ticks jump on humans from trees. As many as 93.5% of youths knew that Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks. The main sources of information about Lyme disease for students and pupils older than 10 years of age are television and radio (40.9%) and the press (37.5%). The frequency of contact of young people with ticks is high--90.4% of children younger than 12 years, and 93.7% of youths from 10 to 26 years of age had at least once an attached tick. 56.1% of youths older than 10 years use oil to remove an attached tick. Almost 23.7% remove ticks with bare hands. People used those methods of tick removal although even children younger than 12 years of age knew that it was an incorrect habit. After removing, a tick is most frequently burned.

AB  - The owner of a farm in a part of the Transvaal where heartwater [ Rickettsia ruminanlium is prevalent observed ticks in the mouths of several cows in the course of a few months when giving them bone meal by hand. In February 1942, one of these cows was examined on the day on which It had been found to be infested; it had a living and apparently normal adult male of Hyalomma impressum Koch, firmly attached to the mucous membrane of the hard palate. The farmer stated that the ticks he had previously found had included several examples of Amblyomma hebraeum Koch, the vector of heartwater; none had been engorged but all were firmly attached and living when removed. Ticks in the mouths of cattle would not be exposed to the usual control measures and might transmit heartwater if they began to feed, but it is unlikely that the females could complete engorgement, as, when distended with blood, they would probably be crushed during mastication and rumination.

AB  - Background: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is associated with a high mortality rate in the Black Sea region of Turkey, has received increasing attention. Objective: In this study, the epidemiological features, clinical and laboratory findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients diagnosed with CCHF between 2006 and 2012 based on data obtained from the Bolu Provincial Directorate of Health (BPDH) were evaluated. Methods: BPDH data were reviewed for the period between 1 January 2006 and 31 July 2012. The locations where the tick had attached to the patient, the site of the tick bite on the patient's body, the dates of tick bite and removal, and the demographic characteristics of each patient were recorded. BPDH data on the total number of tick bites, patients with confirmed CCHF, and deaths due to CCHF in Bolu Province during the study period were also evaluated. Results: A total of 46 patients with CCHF and 38 patients without CCHF but who had been bitten by ticks were admitted to the BPDH. Of the patients with CCHF, 54.3% were female. The mean age of the patients was 46.882.05 years (range, 1-79 years). The mortality rate was 8.82%. Patients were predominantly observed in June and July. When the patients were distributed according to their occupations, the majority was houswife (48.6%), followed by animal husbandry worker (27.0%), farmer (10.8%), health worker (5.4%), and other (8.1%). The symptoms of the patients with CCHF included fatigue (60.9%), fever (60.9%), and myalgia (60.9%). Of those patients with CCHF, 41.3% were determined to have a high fever. Conclusions: The probability of developing CCHF decreased as the duration of tick attachment increased. Moreover, although the clinical presentation is important, it is not diagnostic. Physical examination and laboratory findings become more specific in later stages.

AB  - The fast and safe removal of ticks is of medical and veterinary importance since many tick-borne pathogens require time to be transmitted. In the past, many tools and applications were used to remove ticks from the skin of humans and pets. Choking the ticks by blocking their respiratory system with chemicals cannot be recommended due to the low respiratory rate of ticks. Mechanical devices to remove ticks are usually recommended; however, they vary with regard to their mechanism of seizing and holding the tick and in the way of extraction (pulling or twisting). In this study, five commercial tick removal devices with different mechanisms were tested on pets according to their practicability, injury of the mouthparts, and the idiosoma of female Ixodes ricinus ticks. Therefore, 22 veterinarians and four pet owners removed 596 ticks from various animals by using the different devices and filled in a questionnaire for each case. The tick species and instars were determined, and for the female I. ricinus ticks ( n=527) the condition of the mouthparts as well as the idiosoma was evaluated. Twisting of the female I. ricinus ticks reduced the force required for extraction, the adverse reaction of the animal and the time needed for removal. The device with a "V"-shaped slot which allows a grabbing of the mouthparts delivered the best results according to the condition of the mouthparts and the intactness of the female I. ricinus tick's body. Therefore, grabbing the mouthparts and twisting can be recommended for removal of I. ricinus females from pets.

AB  - The fast and safe removal of ticks is of medical and veterinary importance since many tick-borne pathogens require time to be transmitted. In the past, many tools and applications were used to remove ticks from the skin of humans and pets. Choking the ticks by blocking their respiratory system with chemicals cannot be recommended due to the low respiratory rate of ticks. Mechanical devices to remove ticks are usually recommended; however, they vary with regard to their mechanism of seizing and holding the tick and in the way of extraction (pulling or twisting). In this study, five commercial tick removal devices with different mechanisms were tested on pets according to their practicability, injury of the mouthparts, and the idiosoma of female Ixodes ricinus ticks. Therefore, 22 veterinarians and four pet owners removed 596 ticks from various animals by using the different devices and filled in a questionnaire for each case. The tick species and instars were determined, and for the female I. ricinus ticks (n=527) the condition of the mouthparts as well as the idiosoma was evaluated. Twisting of the female I. ricinus ticks reduced the force required for extraction, the adverse reaction of the animal and the time needed for removal. The device with a "V"-shaped slot which allows a grabbing of the mouthparts delivered the best results according to the condition of the mouthparts and the intactness of the female I. ricinus tick's body. Therefore, grabbing the mouthparts and twisting can be recommended for removal of I. ricinus females from pets. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

AB  - Aim: After the first description of a CCHF outbreak in Turkey, tick bites became an increasing cause of visits to health-care facilities. In this study, we evaluated tick bites in a CCHF endemic region. Materials and methods: The study included cases of tick bites that were referred to 2 hospitals in Erzurum between June and October 2008. All cases were followed-up for 10 days for the results of CCHF. Results: During the study period, 161 patients were admitted for a tick bite. The majority (56.3%) were farmers and housewives. Children &#8804; 13 years of age were bitten mostly on the head and neck (44.4%), while adults were bitten mostly on their legs (42.6%). Of the tick attachment sites, 18.3% were on non-visible regions of the body of the victims. In 39.1% of the cases, ticks were removed by medical staff. During a 10-day follow-up, CCHF occurred in 2 cases (1.2%). Conclusion: A tick bite poses an important problem for the resident population in CCHF endemic areas. A detailed body inspection after each outing in areas of possible contact with ticks, as well as the early removal of an attached tick, is important to prevent tick-borne diseases. An inspection of the non-visible regions of the body of the victim should be performed by another person. Education of public and medical staff is required for the prevention and management of tick bites.

AB  - In this article, literature records of argasid and ixodid ticks feeding on humans worldwide are provided in view of increased awareness of risks associated with tick bites. Ticks can cause paralyses, toxicoses, allergic reactions and are vectors of a broad range of viral, rickettsial, bacterial and protozoan pathogens. Approximately 12 argasid species (Argas and Ornithodos) are frequently found attached to humans who intrude into tick-infested caves and burrows. Over 20 ixodid tick species are often found on humans exposed to infested vegetation: four of these are Amblyomma species, 7 Dermacentor spp., 3 Haemaphysalis spp., 2 Hyalomma spp. and 6 Ixodes species. Personal protection methods, such as repellents and acaricide-impregnated clothing are advised to minimize contact with infected ticks. Acaricidal control of ixodid ticks is impractical because of their wide distribution in forested areas, but houses infested with soft ticks can be sprayed with acaricidal formulations. Attached ticks should be removed without delay. The best way is to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with fine tweezers and pull firmly and steadily without twisting. Finally, despite the fact that most people who are bitten destroy the offending tick in disgust, it is recommended that they preserve specimens in ethanol for taxonomic identification and detection of pathogens by molecular methods.

AB  - Regression equations, based on scutal index (body length/scutal width), were developed to determine the duration of attachment for nymphal and adult female lxodes scapularis ticks. Feeding times were calculated for 444 nymphal and 300 female ticks submitted by bite victims between 1985 and 1989 in Westchester County, New York, an area where Lyme disease is highly endemic. Nymphs were attached for a mean of 34.7 hours, with 26.8% removed after 48 hours, the critical time for transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi. Attachment times increased with victim age class (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.05). Mean duration of attachment for female ticks (28.7 hours) was significantly less (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.05) than that for nymphs, with 23.3% attached for more than 48 hours. The 0- to 9-year age class had the highest proportion (37.1%) of females attached for more than 48 hours. Nymphs remain attached to adult tick-bite victims longer than they remain attached to children. However, children have a high risk of acquiring Lyme disease because they receive more nymphal bites and also because they are less likely to have female ticks removed in time to prevent transmission.

AB  - As a rule, the tick, Ixodes ricinus, is picked up when its victim walks through low vegetation and brushes it off a leaf or blade of grass. Often hours later, the tick scores the skin at the site it selects and then pushes its barbed hypostome into the tiny wound to anchor itself to its victim with the aid of a cement-like substance and the barbs. While it sucks up blood, Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes pass out of the tick's intestine into its salivary glands and thence into the host. It is therefore of decisive importance that the tick be removed with a special forceps as early as possible. The use of such substances as glue, alcohol or nail varnish to remove the tick must be discouraged. Currently, antibiotic prophylaxis, examination of the tick for the presence of B. burgdorferi, or serological follow-up tests are not recommended.

AB  - In Europe the multi-system disorder Lyme borreliosis is caused by at least four different Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species. Therefore, genetic and antigenic heterogeneity is a major challenge for development of diagnostic methods. Serological diagnosis should follow the principle of a two-step procedure: for screening a sensitive IgM and IgG differentiating ELISA is recommended that should be confirmed by immunoblot in the case of reactivity. Detection of specific antibodies can only be judged if the immunoblot is positive. Sensitivity of antibody detection is 20%-50% in stage I, 70%-90% in stage II, and nearly 100% in stage III. The use of recombinant antigens - e.g., primarily in vivo expressed proteins such as VlsE or homologues of immunodominant antigens of different strains such as DbpA - leads to an improvement in serological diagnosis. Detection of the aetiological agent from skin biopsies, cerebrospinal fluid, and synovial fluid or synovial tissue by culture or PCR should be confined to specific indications. Sensitivity is 50%-70% for skin biopsies and synovial fluid (the latter only by PCR), and 10%-30% for cerebrospinal fluid. Methods that are not recommended for diagnostic purposes include antigen tests in body fluids, PCR for urine or whole blood/serum, lymphocyte transformation test, or testing of ticks removed from humans to deduce an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - Tick bites are best prevented by people avoiding tick-infested areas. When this is not possible, tick bites may be prevented by the wearing of long trousers that are tucked into boots. The best method to avoid tick bites is twofold: application of a topical deet (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) repellent to exposed skin, and treatment of clothing with permethrin. This system is currently used by the US Army to protect soldiers. Ticks can crawl underneath clothing and bite untreated portions of the body; therefore, treating clothing is imperative. Permethrin is nontoxic to humans, and can be used in any age group. Permethrin is commercially available. Checking clothing regularly while in tick-infested areas is highly recommended to back up the few hours of protection provided by the insect repellents. It is also recommended that the entire body be carefully screened for ticks and other parasites by campers and hunters while they are staying in and after leaving infested areas. Any tick found should be removed immediately. Removing ticks may not be easy. It is best to use blunt, rounded forceps, and a magnifying glass to remove ticks, especially when immature ticks are found. The forceps are used to grasp the mouthparts of the tick as close as possible to the skin, and then the tick is pulled upward, perpendicular to the skin, with a continuous and steady action. Usually any mouth parts of the tick retained in the skin are eliminated uneventfully by the body. Other methods of removing ticks, such as using fingers, lighted cigarettes, petroleum jelly, or suntan oil, should be avoided. Killing the tick in situ may increase the risk of regurgitation by the tick and the transmission of infectious agents. Most stick bites are uncomplicated, and result only in benign cutaneous inflammatory reactions that may be pruritic for a few days. As a result of mouthparts being retained at the feeding site, a granuloma may rarely develop. There are no data to indicate that antimicrobial prophylaxsis is beneficial to the tick-bitten patient to prevent disease. It must be kept in mind that the risk of transmission of disease increases with the duration of attachment and generally requires greater than 24 to 48 hours. The degree of tick engorgement or the time since tick exposure and discovery of the tick may be used to establish the likely duration of attachment and the risk of disease transmission. Reducing and controlling tick populations is difficult. Habitat modifications, including vegetation management by cutting, burning, and herbicide treatment, and drainage of wet areas are one strategy for tick control, but their effects are often short-lived, and they can cause severe ecologic damage. Chemicals used to control ticks may cause environmental contamination, and therefore, toxicity for humans and animals. Biologic control methods for ticks include the promotion of natural predators. Natural predators of ticks are beetles, spiders, and ants, and parasites such as insects, mites and nematodes. Tick control is best based on the concept of integrated pest management, in which different control methods are adapted to one area or against one tick species with due consideration to their environmental effects. Tick-borne diseases are increasing in prevalence. Perhaps it is because people are undertaking more outdoor activities, which result in contact with ticks and their pathogens. Clinicians should be aware of the clinical sign of tick-transmitted diseases, because morbidity and mortality as a result of these diseases increases substantially if there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. Tick-borne illness occur in distinctive geographic areas. The reporting of these illnesses and diseases to the health department enables the gathering of information and statistics. The public should be informed about the risks of disease in tick-infested areas and the means of preventing infections. The most common diseases are caused by Rickettsia, Borrelia, and Ehrichia, but with continued study, new pathogens and diseases will continue to emerge. [Refer

AB  - A survey was carried out in Hungary to investigate the occurrence of hard tick species (Acari: Ixodidae) collected from dogs and Borrelia and Babesia spp. detected in them. In total, 1,424 ticks were removed from 477 dogs appearing for clinical consultation in veterinary practices and clinics countrywide. Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus were the most common species occurring in most of the studied areas. Females of these two species were selected for molecular analyses. One to twelve specimens were used in each sample for DNA extraction. Polymerase chain reactions were performed with BSLF/BSL-R primers for detecting Borrelia spp. in I. ricinus and with PIRO-A1/PIRO-B primers to amplify Babesia spp. DNA in D. reticulatus. Randomly selected PCR products were sequenced to identify the pathogens' species or subspecies. DNA of Borrelia spp. could be detected in six (5.6%) from 108 I. ricinus samples and 43 (29.9%) from 144 D. reticulatus samples were PCR-positive for Babesia spp. Sequencing revealed the highest similarity with Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii and Babesia canis canis, respectively. Babesia and Borrelia spp. were identified in ticks with molecular methods for the first time in Hungary, and a high prevalence of B. canis canis in D. reticulatus females collected from dogs was detected.

AB  - This paper contains an account of the work done by Gaiger during a visit to Peru in the latter half of 1916 with the object of investigating the disease already discussed in the preceding extract. The work was conducted on behalf of a number of sheep farmers who were suffering very considerable economic losses owing to the large mortality amongst their lambs each year. The laboratory material necessary was taken out from England. Gaiger first gives a good description of the peculiar local geographic and climatic conditions prevailing in Peru together with the sheep-farming customs. The native sheep, which are of a very poor type, are now being improved by crossing; mostly with the Romney Marsh breed. The small laboratory was fitted up on a large sheep farm-Atocsaico Farm, owned by a British company. This farm was situated at an altitude of 14, 000 feet and lay on rolling grass country, the Home Farm being situated in a valley on the banks of a small stream. A brief description is given of the history of the disease. The word renguera is said to be probably derived from the Spanish word rengna meaning "injured in the back, " and Gaiger remarks that there is a complete absence of any reliable information about the origin and spread of the disease, and does not discuss the probable source of its introduction. Owing to the confusion in the classification of sheep diseases the word remuera, has come to be used in the case of nearly every sick lamb and the losses attributed to it are said to have been grossly exaggerated, although at the same time the disease itself undoubtedly causes very considerable losses. The disease had been known at Atocsaico for six years. At first the cases were few in number but they became doubled each successive year until in 1915 they amounted to about 700 out of 5, 000 lambs born. On neighbouring farms the losses were very much greater and also increasing every year in importance, one farmer stating that he had lost every lamb in 1915 from the disease. The disease was probably first noticed in Peru about 15 years ago. It is stated to occur only in sheep but it was also reported to affect young llamas. [img 8X5462.tif] These hoggets were being driven to the right when photographed. In falling they nearly always swing half round and fall facing the opposite direction to that in which they were walking. One is seen with its hind quarters collapsing cattle and horses are not susceptible. Symptoms commence in lambs from the age of about 14 days and fresh cases keep on occurring up to the age of 5 to 6 months. The description of the symptoms is similar to that given by TABUSSO. A not uncommon symptom in bad cases in lambs is slight up and down trembling of the head and more rarely this symptom extends to the whole body, which shivers as though from cold; a peculiar symptom in these cases is a frequent grinding of the teeth, making a noise which can be heard 10 or 20 yards away. Clinically, renguera is a disease of the nervous system and resembles an intoxication by some poison working on that system. In 1915 the author believes that a mortality of 8 or 9 per cent, on Atocsaico Farm was caused by the disease, but, owing to the inclusion of a number of other diseases under the same name the losses were estimated by the farmers to be much higher. Gaiger, also, notes that it is doubtful whether renguera of itself would account for many deaths; the cause of death in most cases is inanition produced by the inability to obtain nourishment on account of the paralytic symptoms. In 1916 the mortality was high owing to the prolonged dry season and the lambs were born long before the grass began to grow. It is denied that the mortality is increased by cold and damp for, in 1916, it was exceptionally dry and renguera commenced sooner and in younger lambs than ever before. Owing to the very rapid onset of putrefaction after death it was decided to attach no importance to post-mortem examinations of animals which had died a natural death; even in apparently healthy lambs Gaiger showed that there may be an invasion, especially with the Bacillus coli, from the bowels. The lesions discoverable in the more severe cases in young lambs are said to be as follows: (1) increase in the peritoneal, pericardial, and pleural fluids, these being frequently slightly tinged with haemoglobin; (2) a darker colour of the liver in most cases; (3) slight, but never marked, increase in the colouring of the meninges of the brain and spinal cord; (4) occasional catarrhal condition of the small intestine in lambs; and (5) a not infrequent patchy endocarditis. The disease is compared with other important non-inoculable sheep diseases whose aetiology is unknown, viz., louping-ill, scrapie or lumbar prurigo, and swingback in the British Isles, and pataleta in Patagonia. Neither scrapie nor louping-ill exist in Peru but both renguera and louping-ill probably exist in Patagonia and are confused together under the name of pataleta. The clinical symptoms of renguera in its most chronic form are indistinguishable from those of swingback in England, and it may be more than a coincidence that renguera has appeared in a part of the world where considerable numbers of Romney Marsh sheep have been imported. It is possible to produce symptoms similar to those of renguera by injuring the spinal cord with a fine syringe needle at the seat of lumbar puncture but these symptoms only last for a short while. The absence of ticks removed one factor which would have had to be studied as a possible cause, knowing what one does of the action of Ixodes pilosus in Cape Colony and Dermacentor venustus in British Columbia in producing paralysis in sheep. No organisms were discoverable in smears from the blood or any of the other tissues or fluids of the body by direct microscopic examination. The following were the gross parasites found commonly affecting sheep and lambs: - (1) Fasciola hepatica, very common in the liver of practically every sheep examined. They were to be found in lambs from about two months old. (2) Dictyocaulus filaria. Was very common but never in very great numbers. It was also common in the hoggets and found in lambs over two months old. (3) Trichocephalus affinis. Is perhaps the commonest parasite with which sheep are affected, and is present in greater numbers than any other worm. Found in lambs from about 3 weeks old. (4) Oesophagostomum radiatum. Was frequently found but usually in very small numbers. (5) Monieza expansa. Was sometimes present in adult sheep. (6) Cysticercus tenuicollis. Was very frequently present in the mesentery of hoggets and adults. (7) Haemonchus contortus. Was sometimes seen but rarely present in numbers over six or eight in one animal. None of the above parasites could be blamed for producing such symptoms as those of renguera; they were to be found equally numerous in renguera animals and apparently healthy animals. Also, neither chemical poisons nor poisonous plants could be blamed and no protozoan infection was discoverable. The author then gives details of a number of experiments carried out with a view to attempting to transmit the disease artificially. Inoculation experiments with brain, blood, cerebro-spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pericardial fluid all failed to set up any symptoms and feeding experiments likewise remained negative. " Inoculation and feeding experiments having failed to transmit the disease it seemed unnecessary in the absence of ticks to resort to cohabitation experiments to see if the disease could be transmitted in this way." Gaiger then details a large number of cultural experiments which demonstrated the almost constant association of a micrococcus with the disease. These were performed with great care and under difficulties owing to the low boiling point of water at the high altitude of the sheep farm. The technique adopted in obtaining cerebro-spinal fluid is described. Amongst the cases in the sierra the coccus was thus found by cultural experiments to be present in the peritoneal fluid in 30 out of 43, pleural fluid in 4 out of 14, pericardial fluid in 5 out of 14, liver in 11 out of 30, gall bladder in 1 case out of 1, blood in 5 out of 25, central nervous system in 10 out of 38, and brain in 1 out of 5 cases in which it was examined. The coccus is stated to have also been found in cases subsequently examined by TABUSSO in his laboratory at the Agricultural College in Lima. Inoculation experiments with this coccus were made into ten lambs and two rabbits intraperitoneally, intra-spinally, by injection into the nasal cavities, or by feeding, with negative results. An attempt was made to find the coccus in young healthy lambs on Atocsaico. Five were examined and the coccus was found in two in the peritoneal fluid and in one of these two it was also present in the blood. In the other three healthy lambs the coccus did not grow from any of the fluids or tissues of the body but in one case Bacillus coli grew from the peritoneal fluid. Large doses of culture of the coccus failed to set up the disease and so the author made an attempt to find out whether the symptoms might not be caused by the manufacture of a toxin. Peritoneal fluid from a renguera case was pipetted off into a culture tube and incubated for seven days; 1 c.c. of this fluid inoculated intra-spinally into a lamb produced no apparent ill-effect. The role of this coccus in the evolution of the disease cannot be determined until one is able to transmit the disease experimentally from infected to healthy animals. The serum of infected animals showed no agglutinative properties for an emulsion of the coccus. With regard to the cultural characters of this coccus the author found that it was sometimes difficult to obtain a first growth, from the body fluids. A visible growth was often only obtained after incubation at body temperature for several days. Egg medium was sometimes successful in obtaining a primary growth when other media failed. Sub-cultures grew readily on all ordinary media. There was no growth on gelatin at 20° C. ; in broth the organism produced a turbidity which then settled as a distinct deposit to the bottom of the tube. On agar the growth was a clear shining semi-transparent film without colour. On solid media the first growths from the body were sometimes isolated colonies of which there might be five or six scattered over the surface, but more frequently the growth originated in the water of condensation in the bottom of the tube. The coccus prefers a medium slightly alkaline and will not grow on an acid medium. It is preferably an aerobe but grows fairly well under anaerobic conditions. It produces acid and does not ferment glucose or lactose. The paper concludes with a discussion of the measures that can be adopted to eradicate the disease. Curative measures hold out little promise of success. In judging the efficiency of preventive measures care must be taken to avoid falling into error as very little has ever been done on the sheep farm in the way of keeping proper statistics. The author's view is that the rise and fall of the disease is solely due to the age of the lambs and that the wet or dry seasons do not exert any distinctive influence except as regards their exceptional severity. Experiments in altering the breeding season are about to be made on Atocsaico to see whether the losses from frosts and starvation will be reduced by having the lambs born in April instead of September and it will be instructive to learn whether renguera occurs when the April lambs are a week old or not. Also, experiments are to be made to show the effect of breeding from some of the least affected or " recovered " hoggets and the number of cases which occur among the resulting lambs. Further experiments are to be made to determine the preventive value of inoculation of a serum immune against the coccus into young lambs. All lambs are to be destroyed and buried as soon as they become infected. On one farm it was believed that feeding with a mixture of salt and sulphur produced beneficial results.

AB  - Lyme disease is a vector-borne infectious disease affecting especially skin, nervous system, heart and joints. In the early stage of borrelia infection, asymptomatic course is possible. The causative agent, the spirochete Borrelia, is carried to the human body by tick. The bacteriological culture from blood, joint fluid or cerebrospinal fluid is very difficult. The laboratory diagnosis depends mainly on serological assays (ELISA, Western blot) and on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The treatment is based on antibiotic therapy - penicillin's and cephalosporins. The period of therapy depends on clinical form of borreliosis. Early tick removing is the best borreliosis prophylaxis.

AB  - Many methods of tick removal that have been reported in the literature have proved to be unsatisfactory in controlled studies. Some methods may even cause harm by inducing the tick to salivate and regurgitate into the host. Ticks are best removed as soon as possible, because the risk of disease transmission increases significantly after 24 hours of attachment. The use of a blunt, medium-tipped, angled forceps offers the best results. Following tick removal, the bite area should be inspected carefully for any retained mouthparts, which should be excised. The area is then cleaned with antiseptic solution, and the patient is instructed to monitor for signs of local or systemic illness. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis following tick removal generally is not indicated but may be considered in pregnant patients or in areas endemic to tick-borne disease. [References: 26]

AB  - Ticks are obligate haematophagous arthropods present all over the world able to produce human diseases. Several factors have increased the abundance, circulation and distribution of the pathogens transmitted by ticks, contributing to the change in the vector-borne diseases epidemiology in the last years. This review collects the most important measures for the prevention and prophylaxis of tick-borne diseases. The preexposition measures to avoid tick-borne diseases are based on the prevention of tick bites by avoiding tickinfested areas, using of protective clothing, repellents and controlling tick populations by physical, mechanical, biological and chemical methods. It is also reviewed other measures as the utility of educational programs and the use of human vaccines. On the other hand, we also review some key aspects referred to the measures to carry out after tick bites as how to remove a tick correctly and the utility of making an antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent responsible for causing Lyme disease in humans and animals, is transmitted via the bite of infected Ixodes spp. ticks. Ticks removed from humans and animals are routinely tested by diagnostic laboratories to determine if they are infected with these bacteria. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 2 commonly used methods, direct fluorescent antibody staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for the detection of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes scapularis ticks. One hundred and twenty-seven adult I. scapularis ticks collected in Connecticut, a Lyme disease endemic area, were tested, and results were compared. Results showed 24.8% ticks tested positive for Borrelia spp. by fluorescent antibody testing and 32.5% ticks were positive for B. burgdorferi by real-time PCR testing. When ticks were grouped into categories by level of engorgement (unengorged, partially engorged, and fully engorged), 95% of unengorged ticks, 90.5% of partially engorged, and 86.8% of engorged ticks tested were in agreement. Ten of the 127 ticks examined were too dehydrated to be tested by the fluorescent antibody technique; half of these tested positive by PCR. Real-time PCR appears to be the better of these 2 methods for the diagnosis of this bacterial infection in I. scapularis ticks.

AB  - The development of A. marginale was studied in ticks using a nonradioactive in situ hybridization method developed in the authors' laboratory. Males of D. andersoni were infected intrastadially by allowing them to feed for 7 days on an infected calf (acquisition feeding). The ticks were then removed and held in a humidity chamber for 5 days before being fed on a 2nd susceptible calf for 10 days (transmission feeding). Two groups of 10 ticks were collected daily during the 22-day experiment. In one group, one-half of each tick was processed and embedded in paraffin and in the other group one-half of each tick was embedded in LR White for in situ hybridization. The companion tick halves from each group were fixed and embedded in Dow Epoxy Resin for routine light and electron microscopy. As detected by in situ hybridization on LR White- and paraffin-embedded sections and by microscopy, initial infection of A. marginale in ticks occurred in gut tissues either on the 7th day of acquisition feeding or the 1st day of the held period and infection persisted throughout transmission feeding. The highest number of ticks with gut infection was observed on the 5th day of transmission feeding. Salivary glands became infected with A. marginale on the 1st day of transmission feeding and remained infected throughout the transmission feeding period. Peak infection was observed on Day 4 of transmission feeding. After the beginning of transmission feeding, A. marginale infection was also observed in interstitial, reproductive, skeletal muscle, fat body and Malpighian tubule tissues. Although A. marginale infection of ticks clearly originates in midgut epithelial cells, many tissues eventually become infected during transmission feeding, resulting in a generalized infection. The infection of multiple tissues may contribute to the ability of A. marginale infection to persist in intrastadially infected male ticks.

AB  - This article provides a brief overview of some diseases transmitted by ticks. These vectors do not transmit only Lyme disease and tickborne-encephalitis, even in Switzerland. Several tick-borne diseases cause nonspecific flu-like symptoms. Nevertheless sometimes severe, some of these diseases can be treated with specific treatments. Repellents, appropriate clothes impregnated with permethrine and prompt removal of the tick are effective preventive measures to limit the risk of infection. There is an effective vaccine which protects against tick-borne encephalitis.

AB  - This article describes a technique for removing a tick from skin by tightening a single over hand knot in a monofilament fishing line around the tick's mouthparts, and reports the results of a study (in Italy) conducted to investigate the efficiency of the method. Ten ambulatory children aged 4-13 years with 17 attached Ixodes ricinus nymph were enrolled. All ticks were successfully detached alive with the fishing line; 12 ticks were completely removed while 5 had some retained mouth parts removed with tweezers (71% success rate of removing tick intact). The ticks were all less than 2.5 mm in length. On follow up, no patient showed any sign of local infection or zoonosis. Based on the study, tick removal using a fishing line appears to have a high success rate. However areas covered with hairs might make this method difficult to apply.

AB  - This guide was written "to minimize the effects of ticks and tickborne diseases on military personnel by providing information on the species present in an area, notes on their biology, guidance for control strategies, and descriptions of tickborne diseases". It is divided into 5 main chapters, viz: historical accounts of ticks affecting military personnel (e.g. at Camp Bullis, Texas, and Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas); basic tick biology and ecology; management of tick problems on military deployments (education programs, host management, vegetation management, training site selection, area control, aerial spray, other methods of tick control, personal protection, tick removal); major human tickborne diseases (Lyme disease, Rocky mountain spotted fever, Boutonneuse fever, Siberian tick typhus, tularaemia, Colorado tick fever, tickborne relapsing fever, tickborne encephalitis, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, American babesiosis, tick paralysis, human ehrlichiosis); biology, distribution and medical importance of common ticks affecting military operations (29 species listed, including species of Ornithodoros, Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Dermacentor, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus). Each chapter has its own list of references and is illustrated with line drawings and photographs. Photographs are given for the identification of representative species, and distribution maps are also provided.

AB  - Objective: Ticks play a role in transmission of varies of viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases. Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), has widest geographic distribution among these tick born diseases. In this study, it was aim to evaluate the tick bite cases admitted to the state Hospital in Tokat where CCHF is endemic in this region. Method: Tick bite cases, between 1 April and 30 September 2009, admitted to the State Hospital of Tokat were assessed retrospectively in terms of frequency of CCHF disease development; demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Results: In this study, 312 tick bites cases were evaluated. 182 of these cases were male and 130 were female. Of the cases, 21,1% was under the age of 16 years old and the mean age was 34,414,6. Of the cases, 56,4% were living in urban area and 81% of the ticks were removed by the health personnel in the state hospital. The most common body area bitten by the ticks were the lower extremities. Most of the cases were recorded in May, June, July and August and, CCHF developed in eight cases. Conclusion: Cases of tick bites should be carefully monitored in terms of symptoms and signs in endemic areas in which CCHF is seen. People living in these regions, should be trained in terms of preventive measures to be taken against tick bite, and the applications after tick bite.

AB  - A bioassay method using mice was developed of comparing the toxin content of extracts of the salivary glands of Ixodes holocyclus Neum. (a tick causing paralysis in mammals in Australia by its bite) at various stages of feeding. The quantity of toxin increased rapidly from the third day of feeding. Toxin production continued and increased in ticks removed from mice after 3.5 days and held at 30 deg C and 92% RH for 24 h, whereas no toxin was detected in the salivary glands of ticks fed for 3 days and treated similarly. It is suggested that major physiological changes occur in the salivary glands of I. holocyclus on the third day which, when once stimulated, continue independently of feeding. Toxin production in ticks was not suppressed by passively immunising host mice with anti-tick toxin, but is was suppressed in ticks fed on hosts with a previous experience of tick feeding. It is concluded that, in order to obtain salivary glands containing high concentrations of toxin for chemical analysis, it is necessary to allow the salivary glands to develop for 5 days after the initial attachment of the tick to a host with no previous experience of tick feeding. This can be achieved by passively immunising mice against the toxin, which enables the ticks to feed for 5 days without killing the mouse, or by keeping the ticks for 24 h at 30 deg C and 92% RH following the death of the mouse on the fourth day.

AB  - External auditory canal tick bites are quite rare conditions. Ticks are arthropods that mediate transmission of many diseases including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Climatic changes caused by global warming, seasonal changes and geographic location are factors facilitating the reproduction of tick population and increasing the occurence of tick borne diseases. The aim of this report was to present patients who presented to our clinic with tick bite. One patient presented with a sense of mobile foreign body in the ear and another one with ear obstruction. While the third patient had excessive itching, the fourth one had an earache. The patients did not have other systemic or local complaints. The examination of the external auditory canal revealed a tick attached to the posterior upper part of the right external auditory canal in the first patient. A tick was attached to the left tympanic membrane in the second patient with ear obstruction. In the third and the fourth patients, ticks were close to the skin of the left external auditory canal. Ticks were removed carefully from the external auditory canal and they were obtained alive. The patients were monitored in an outpatient setting for 14 days after being informed about the complaints. No additional problems developed on follow-up. The technique of removal of the ticks from the body and follow up measures were presented in this paper. (copyright) 2012 by Turkiye Klinikleri.

AB  - Migratory birds are known to play a role in the long-distance transportation of microorganisms. To investigate whether this is true for rickettsial agents, we undertook a study to characterize tick infestation in populations of the migratory passerine bird Riparia riparia (Passeriformes: Hirundinidae), the sand martin. A total of 194 birds were sampled and ticks removed from infested birds. The ticks were identified as female Ixodes lividus (Acari: Ixodidae) using standard morphological and molecular techniques. Tick DNA was assayed to detect Rickettsia spp. using polymerase chain reaction and DNA was sequenced for species identification. A single Rickettsia spp. was detected in 100% of the ticks and was designated Rickettsia sp. IXLI1. Partial sequences of 17-kDa and ompA genes showed greatest similarity to Rickettsia sp. TCM1, an aetiological agent of Japanese spotted fever-like illness, previously described in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Rickettsia sp. IXLI1 fitted neatly into a group containing strains Rickettsia japonica, Rickettsia sp. strain Davousti and Rickettsia heilongjiangensis. In conclusion, this research shows that U.K. migratory passerine birds host ticks infected with Rickettsia species and contribute to the geographic distribution of spotted fever rickettsial agents. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Lyme disease is an expanding community health issue in the United States. This has led to greater public awareness in Canada, although the disease remains rare here. We review the biology of ticks and show how feeding patterns are relevant to disease transmission. Diagnosing Lyme disease is sometimes problematic, but treatment can be effective, particularly in the early stages. Preventive measures are aimed at avoiding tick contact and early tick removal.

AB  - An account is given of a method by which an adult of Dermacentorandersoni Stiles, removed from its host during engorgement, can be induced to secrete an oral fluid into a capillary tube. The tube is tapered to an annealed orifice, which is slid over the hypostome and serves to separate the palps and push back the cheliceral sheath to the position it has when the tick is attached to a host. In view of the possibility of a relationship between the fluid and the production of tick paralysis, which is common in cattle and sometimes affects man in British Columbia [ R.A.E., B 32 80; 33 73; 35 8], a study was made of its secretion in various circumstances. The ticks were detached immediately before use, and were: kept at 30-35°C. [86-95°F.]. As they sometimes withdraw some or all of the fluid after its secretion has ceased, the tubes were removed as soon as they began to do so to prevent loss. Secretion before stimulation by the tube occurred only while a detached portion of the host's skin remained round the rnouth-parts. It was found that the average amount of fluid produced increased as the tick engorged. The largest amounts came from fast-feeding (mated) females [ cf. 33 74] on the fifth and sixth days of feeding. The largest amounts from slow-feeding (unmated) females were obtained between the seventh and eighth days. The average amounts secreted by mated and unmated females were similar in those weighing up to 200 mg., but larger mated ticks occasionally produced more than those that were unmated. The amount produced by individuals varied widely, and the variation was not related to the size of the tick at the time the fluid was secreted or to its size before feeding. After a tick, mated or unmated, had neared repletion or passed the eighth day of feeding, the amount of fluid secreted usually diminished rapidly. These results suggest that tick paralysis is caused by the fluid, since it usually appears only after a tick has been engorging for four days or more, individual ticks seem to vary in their ability to produce it, it can apparently be produced by either slow- or fast-feeding ticks, and it disappears when the feeding tick is removed and occasionally even when it is still attached but is near repletion. Attempts to produce paralysis by injecting the fluid into lambs, mice, a dog and a frog and frog nerve-muscle preparations were, however, unsuccessful.

AB  - Ticks, which can be seen in many areas over the world, are the arthropods feeding from both human and animal blood. Today 850 tick species are known in the family of Argasidae and Ixodidae. From the point of disease transmission, the general characteristic of ticks is their need to feeding with blood in order to pass next stage of development. They can feed from all vertebrates without fishes. The mechanism of disease transmission according to tick bites has not been understood completely yet. Ticks live in wet and copse areas. Pets can carry ticks in their bodies when they go to fields. Ticks inject a toxin that causes a local irritation or mild allergic reaction during the bite. However, most of the tick bites cause either fewer symptoms or none. Ticks should be removed as soon as possible while seen. None of the eradication methods have been successful yet. There are 3 different strategies to prevent tick-borne diseases defined as environmental, intimate and prophylactic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The duration of tick attachment is related to the likelihood of disease transmission. To be able to locate and remove an attached tick is important.
METHODS: Sixty-seven patients presenting with tick bites to the Karadeniz Technical University emergency department and 3 different first-stage health institutions between April and July 2006 were investigated to determine the distribution of the bites.
RESULTS: Tick attachment site distribution was determined as follows: 9% head-neck, 5% arm, 24% stomach-groin, 7% back, 18% chest-shoulder, 25% leg-foot, and 12% hip.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of our study, 20% of ticks attach to regions of the body that patients cannot themselves see. After travel in endemic areas, a complete inspection of the entire body surface is required to achive early tick removal.

AB  - This study was conducted in order to evaluate individuals' knowledge about protection against Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). This descriptive study was carried out among 478 persons, to whom a Family Health Center located within boundaries of Erzurum Metropolitan Municipality, provides health service. A questionnaire form developed by the researchers was used for collecting data. Seventy-one point eight percent of individuals who participated in the study stated they had knowledge about CCHF, 25.9% stated that region was risky in terms of being bitten by ticks, 61.3% stated they could recognize ticks and 56.1% stated that not all tick bites cause the disease. Seventy-seven point eight percent stated CCHF is a virulent disease, 33.1% stated it can be transmitted from human to human and 30.3% stated it can be transmitted from animals to humans. In terms of protection from tick bites, 45, 15.3 and 11.3% of individuals stated wearing clothes to cover the whole body, carefully inspecting the body, and not touching ticks with bare hands, respectively, were good methods. Ninety-two point one percent stated it is necessary to go to a healthcare organization immediately in case of tick bite, whereas 18% of individuals stated it is necessary to remove the tick with tweezers or forceps. The results of this study show most individuals are not well informed about methods for protecting against CCHF, for removing ticks and what precautions to take to protect against tick bites.

AB  - Tick-borne diseases are seen all over the world and their importance rises increasingly. It is noticeably important that disease and death rates due to tick-bites in our country in different areas increased in 2008. In Turkey, the numbers of diseases which are transmitted by ticks are considerably large and all of them are not detected. Reports of isolated facial paralysis cases due to tick infestation in the ear are infrequent in literature. The development of isolated facial paralysis due to ticks can be explained by several theories. This article reports a case report of a 3 year- old girl who was bought to our clinic with severe left ear pain and paresthesia on the left half of her face. She couldn't close her left eye and she lisped. The tick was removed from her external auditory canal surgically.

AB  - Lyme disease is the most common tick borne disease and is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors that transmit the infection to host mammals in endemic foci. Ixodes is infected by Borrelia at larval stage when it feeds on infected mammals. Man is an occasional host. The infection risk is linked to interaction between human and the natural environment. Strategies for prevention are closely related to the enzootic cycle of the Ixodes tick. Environmental measures to reduced tick density or host mammals are expensive, need to be repeated annually and cannot be applied to large areas. The primary prevention could be reduced to personal preventive measures such as reducing the amount of exposed skin and frequent checking for ticks. The risk of Lyme disease transmission after a tick bite is relatively low, and remains under 4%. The transmission rate depends on the duration of feeding. A rapide tick removal with fine tweezers or preferably special forceps and disinfection of the bite site appear to be the best technique. The absence of scientific evidence, and the risk of adverse events does not lead to recommending antimicrobial prophylaxis. Follow-up and educating the patients on the disease, clinical manifestation, and later primary prevention should be undertaken.

AB  - Lyme disease is the most common tick borne disease and is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors that transmit the infection to host mammals in endemic foci. Ixodes is infected by Borrelia at larval stage when it feeds on infected mammals. Man is an occasional host. The infection risk is linked to interaction between human and the natural environment. Strategies for prevention are closely related to the enzootic cycle of the Ixodes tick. Environmental measures to reduced tick density or host mammals are expensive, need to be repeated annually and cannot be applied to large areas. The primary prevention could be reduced to personal preventive measures such as reducing the amount of exposed skin and frequent checking for ticks. The risk of Lyme disease transmission after a tick bite is relatively low, and remains under 4%. The transmission rate depends on the duration of feeding. A rapide tick removal with fine tweezers or preferably special forceps and disinfection of the bite site appear to be the best technique. The absence of scientific evidence, and the risk of adverse events does not lead to recommending antimicrobial prophylaxis. Follow-up and educating the patients on the disease, clinical manifestation, and later primary prevention should be undertaken. [References: 170]

AB  - Background: Wild birds contribute to maintenance and dissemination of vectors and microbes, including those that impact human, domestic animal, and wildlife health. Here we elucidate roles of wild passerine birds, eastern cottontail rabbits ( Sylvilagus floridanus), and Ixodes dentatus ticks in enzootic cycles of two spirochetes, Borrelia miyamotoi and B. andersonii in a region of Michigan where the zoonotic pathogen B. burgdorferi co-circulates. Methods: Over a four-year period, wild birds (n=19,631) and rabbits (n=20) were inspected for tick presence and ear tissue was obtained from rabbits. Samples were tested for Borrelia spirochetes using nested PCR of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (IGS) and bidirectional DNA sequencing. Natural xenodiagnosis was used to implicate wildlife reservoirs. Results: Ixodes dentatus, a tick that specializes on birds and rabbits and rarely bites humans, was the most common tick found, comprising 86.5% of the 12,432 ticks collected in the study. The relapsing fever group spirochete B. miyamotoi was documented for the first time in ticks removed from wild birds (0.7% minimum infection prevalence; MIP, in I. dentatus), and included two IGS strains. The majority of B. miyamotoi-positive ticks were removed from Northern Cardinals ( Cardinalis cardinalis). Borrelia andersonii infected ticks removed from birds (1.6% MIP), ticks removed from rabbits (5.3% MIP), and rabbit ear biopsies (5%) comprised twelve novel IGS strains. Six species of wild birds were implicated as reservoirs for B. andersonii. Frequency of I. dentatus larval and nymphal co-feeding on birds was ten times greater than expected by chance. The relatively well-studied ecology of I. scapularis and the Lyme disease pathogen provides a context for understanding how the phenology of bird ticks may impact B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii prevalence and host associations. Conclusions: Given the current invasion of I. scapularis, a human biting species that serves as a bridge vector for Borrelia spirochetes, human exposure to B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii in this region may increase. The presence of these spirochetes underscores the ecological complexity within which Borrelia organisms are maintained and the need for diagnostic tests to differentiate among these organisms.

AB  - Background: An in vitro artificial feeding technique for hard ticks is quite useful for studying the tick-pathogen interactions. Here, we report a novel semi-artificial feeding technique for the adult parthenogenetic tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, using mouse skin membrane. Findings. Skin with attached adult ticks was removed from the mouse body at 4 to 5 days post-infestation for the construction of the feeding system. This system supplied with rabbit blood was kept in >95% relative humidity at 30°C during the feeding, and ticks were fully engorged (artificially engorged, AE) within 12 to 48 h. For comparison, ticks were fed to engorgement solely on rabbit or mouse for 5 days as controls (naturally engorged on rabbit, NEr, or mouse, NEm). Blood digestion-related gene expression in the midgut and reproductive fitness were compared. Body weight, egg mass weight, egg conversion ratio, and hatchability of eggs did not show any significant differences. We analyzed transcription profiles of selected genes assayed by quantitative RT-PCR and revealed similar patterns of expression between NEr and AE but some differences between NEm and AE or NEm and NEr. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that this semi-artificial feeding technique mimics natural feeding processes of ticks and can be utilized as a standardized method to inoculate pathogens, especially Babesia protozoa, into H. longicornis and possibly other tick species as well. © 2012 Hatta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Ongoing work in oak woods in Killarney National Park in southwestern Ireland is focusing on the factors influencing the fine-scale aggregated distribution of Ixodes ricinus L. (Acari: Ixodidae) on the ground. The extent of reuse of stems of vegetation as questing points by adult ticks was determined by paint-marking stems on which ticks were found, counting and removing these ticks, and subsequently reexamining the same stems for ticks on two further occasions. Overall, an estimated 2,967 stems in 123 separate rush plants ( Juncus effusus L.) were examined. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated a highly significant reoccupancy by ticks of stems previously and recently used. Furthermore, it is shown that the extent of stem reuse by ticks is significantly and positively correlated with the numbers of ticks originally observed on those stems. Although other factors may be involved in generating clumping of ticks, the results are compatible with the proposition that aggregation of I. ricinus on the ground is pheromone-mediated. The findings are discussed in relation to what is known about the powers of lateral movement of I. ricinus on the ground and the possible implications for the performance of tick traps.

AB  - Background: Lyme borreliosis is transmitted by tick bites. Approximately every fifth local tick (Ixodes ricinus) is infected. Transmission, therefore does not occur with every bite, and disease doesn't always follow infection. The goal of the study was to investigate the risks of infection and disease after tick bites in the area of Erlangen/Germany. Methods: Between April 1989 and October 1991 seventy-one of our out-patients (30 females, 41 males) aged 6 months to 29 years had a tick bite and were enrolled into the study. After the ticks had been removed, a blood specimen for a specific Borrelia burgdorferi antibody assay (IFT) was collected. An interview by phone was performed 4 weeks later and an appointment for a second blood collection was arranged. Results: In 69 patients the initial titer was negative, in two patients it was 1:32. Sixty patients could be reached by phone, and in 43 a second blood sample was available. There was seroconversion detectable in 4 instances, two of whom were asymptomatic, one had unspecific symptoms and one developed lymphocytoma. There were no manifestations of late stage disease in the study population. Conclusion: These results confirm the current recommendation of the Bundesgesundheitsamt (German Federal Health Institute) that generally antibiotic treatment after a tickbite is not necessary.

AB  - At no time during the year and in no part of Tanganyika Territory are native cattle entirely free from ticks, but both the numbers and species vary according to the locality and the time of year. Although information on the transmission of African coast fever is incomplete, it is known that Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Neum., is one of the most important vectors and that none of the bont ticks ( Amblyomma spp.) can transmit the disease. When the ticks are not on their hosts, they are subject to the effects of environment, but bont ticks are hardy and are found almost everywhere at all times. Rhipicephalus, on the other hand, is found all the year round only in comparatively moist cool areas; in other areas it is either absent, or present only at certain seasons. Mountain grassland with its cool moist climate and persistent grass cover provides almost ideal conditions for it, dry open thorn thicket is quite unsuitable at almost any season, and between these two extremes are areas that are suitable or unsuitable according to the season. African coast fever has been widespread in East Africa from time immemorial, because a proportion of certain local races of cattle are capable of surviving infection if they contract it when young, and in many places an equilibrium has been reached in which a sufficient number of immune cattle exist to support enough ticks to ensure that all calves become infected, and of these a varying percentage survive. The equilibrium is, however, easily upset. If the cattle increase too greatly, they destroy the vegetation cover that is essential to the ticks; the ticks and consequently the disease die out, the cattle increase still further, and the result is over-stocking, soil erosion and periodic starvation of the animals. On the other hand, if the numbers of cattle are reduced abnormally by rinderpest or trypanosomiasis, infected ticks decrease for lack of hosts and calves grow up without having acquired immunity. The grassy environment remains favourable to the ticks, and when infection is re-introduced the disease spreads rapidly. A few decades ago when slave labour was available, much of the coastal belt was more closely settled and cultivated than at present and conditions there were unfavourable for Glossina but suitable for the production of herds immune from African coast fever. With the suppression of slavery, coastal plantations were abandoned, and Glossina invaded the region and reduced the number of cattle below that necessary for the maintenance of immunity. Thus by 1933 the cattle of the district of Bagamoyo were reduced to small scattered herds and were for the most part susceptible to the disease although they were harbouring large numbers of Rhipicephalus. The infection was re-introduced, and in 1933 and 1934 these herds were practically exterminated. This process is taking place all along the coast, and it is doubtful if any cattle will remain after a year or so, except in places where the herds are protected from fly by large open plains or from African coast fever by dipping. In the Northern Province mortality was high in 1934 because, owing to the severe drought, the only grazing lay in the limited areas of fertile grassland most favourable to ticks. In the two localities in the Central Province where, owing to good grazing, mortality had been particularly high in 1933, it was less severe in 1934 owing to the poorer grazing. With regard to control measures, complete eradication of ticks by systematic dipping is a justifiable aim in certain areas, in other places fuller use should be made of the natural immunizing processes, and elsewhere the disease could be kept in check cheaply by the hand removal of ticks. During 1934 the work of clearing against tsetse fly begun in 1933 in the Mpwapwa region [ cf. R.A.E., B 23 64] was continued, and two strips, each nearly a mile long, now cut across the belt of riverine forest along which Glossina pallidipes, Aust., was advancing westward. Throughout the year a large laboratory herd was kept on the farm, no case of trypanosomiasis was certainly contracted there, and not a single fly was seen. A survey carried out in view of the increasing incidence of trypanosomiasis amongst cattle at Dar-es-Salaam showed that G. pallidipes could be taken at almost any point on the outskirts of the town.

AB  - More than 19,000 human cases of Lyme disease (LD) are reported each year in the United States. Lyme disease cases occur when humans are exposed to the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi through the bite of an infected ixodid tick. The probability of human exposure to infected ticks results from a combination of human behaviors and entomological risk. Human behaviors include use of tick habitats, use of protective clothing, and grooming for tick removal. Entomological risks include the density of ticks in a habitat and the proportion of these that are infected with B. burgdorferi. Recent studies have suggested that humans are at higher risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi near edges between forests and herbaceous communities, including lawns and old fields, but whether this increased risk is a function of human behaviors, entomological risk, or both, is unknown. We assessed entomological risk across forest-old field edges in Dutchess County, NY. Densities of ticks and of infected ticks were considerably higher within forests than at forest-field edges, and were lowest within fields. Thus, edges between forests and fields do not pose a higher entomological risk than do the forests themselves, although risk at the edge is higher than in herbaceous habitat. Landscapes with abundant edges between forested and herbaceous habitat, and roughly even proportions of both, might attract both heavy human use and pose moderately high entomological risk, and thus could be targeted for mitigation. We suggest that determining appropriate methods for reducing human exposure to LD requires differentiating entomological risk from human behaviors. (copyright) 2006 Ecohealth Journal Consortium.

AB  - A method has been developed to extract DNA from alcohol-preserved ticks (Ixodidae and Argasidae). The method combines the lysing property of the chaotropic agent guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) and the nucleic acid-binding property of diatomaceous earth (fossilised cell walls of unicellular algae). Debris from the tick is removed in several sequential washing steps. To monitor the efficiency of this method, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was designed to amplify the 16S mt rRNA gene of 5 tick genera ( Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Rhipicephalus, Argas and Ixodes). Detection of amplification products from this PCR indicated that DNA had been successfully extracted and that Taq-polymerase inhibitors were absent. The extraction method, therefore, enables purification of DNA such that enzymatic analysis is possible.

AB  - The duration of tick feeding is an important indicator to evaluate the risk of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato transmission, which increases considerably with the blood meal duration. This blood meal duration may be estimated from scutal index, the ratio between body length (idiosoma) and scutum width. For the estimation of blood meal duration in Ixodes ricinus, nymphal and adult female ticks were detached at predetermined intervals (24, 48, 72, and 96h) from laboratory mice and rabbits and their scutal index calculated. From this, non-linear regression equations were developed to determine the duration of attachment for nymphal and adult female I. ricinus ticks. As part of an epidemiological study addressing the risk of subclinical (seroconversion) and clinical infections after a tick bite in the Neuchatel area (Switzerland) over 3 years (2003-2005), duration of tick attachment and anatomical site of bites collected on participants as well as seasonal distribution of tick bites were studied. Tick attachment duration was estimated in all ticks collected during this study (n=261). Nymphs were attached for a mean (+/- standard error, SE) of 31.6h (+/-2.6) and females for a mean (+/-SE) of 29.6h (+/-3.2). Most nymphs were removed after 24h of blood meal whereas most females were removed before 24h. Legs were the major anatomical sites of bites for women (40.7%), men (44.4%), and almost all age classes. Only children <10 years old were bitten more frequently on the head (41.2%) and on the neck (38.5%) than participants >10 years. The majority of tick bites were recorded from May to July during the 3 years. Attachment sites can influence the discovery of ticks, hence the duration of the tick bite. A detailed body examination after each outing in forest and an early withdrawal of an attached tick is an effective way to prevent Lyme borreliosis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to detect Anaplasma phagocytophilum in wild and domesticated animals and to identify the phylogenetic relationships of different strains of this bacterium. We adapted six published conventional methods targeting 16S fragments for real-time polymerase chain reaction. Initial screening of samples from 419 animals found 37 Anaplasma positives, later confirmed with several different primers and a TaqMan probe. We also performed DNA quantification and melting curve analysis. The nucleic acid of Anaplasma sp. was detected in a higher percentage of cases in members of the deer family, hares, bank voles and mice (12.5-15%) than in foxes, boars, cows, and horses (around 4-6%). We also performed blood analysis of cows, horses, mice, and ticks removed from animals, evaluating the presence of antibodies against granulocytic Anaplasma sp. Finally, we subjected 11 randomly selected PCR amplified products to direct sequencing and we constructed the corresponding phylogenetic tree with respect to the Ehrlichia equi sequence, homologous to the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent. Mutual identity of the sequencing ranged from 99% to 100%.

We also performed blood analysis of cows, horses, mice, and ticks removed from animals, evaluating the presence of antibodies against granulocytic Anaplasma sp. Finally, we subjected 11 randomly selected PCR amplified products to direct sequencing and we constructed the corresponding phylogenetic tree with respect to the Ehrlichia equi sequence, homologous to the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent. Mutual identity of the sequencing ranged from 99% to 100%.

AB  - Corynebacterium ovis was recovered from pathological conditions in four deer in British Columbia. The organism was indistinguishable from strains of C. ovis recovered from sheep. One deer was exposed to infection by scarification of the skin and another by drenching with sheep strains. Both animals became infected. Two sheep were similarly infected with deer strains, but the sheep appeared to be more resistant to deer strains than the deer to sheep strains. A lamb, however, injected by the intravenous route with a deer strain died in five days with an acute pulmonary infection. G. pigs and rabbits were highly susceptible to infection, while rats and magpies were resistant to oral administration but susceptible to infection by the intra-peritoneal route; fitches were resistant to the former and fairly resistant to the latter method. Chickens were not susceptible. Engorged female ticks ( Dermacentor albipictus) removed from infected deer were shown to be harbouring C: ovis and the larvae reared from similar females were also shown to be harbouring the infection, indicating that the organism had been hereditarily transmitted.-R.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disorder common in childhood. It is an acute and persistent anthropozoonotic infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) which is transmitted by Ixodes ticks. After the tick bite in summer, erythema migrans, meningoradiculoneuritis, or carditis may develop within the same season. Later manifestations may be oligo-arthritis, progressive encephalomyelitis, or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The most common course is probably asymptomatic. Connatal infection is possible. Diagnosis is established mainly by history and clinical manifestations. The antibody response to Bb can be measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Tests may be false-negative early in the course of the disease or after early treatment. False-positive results may be caused by cross-reactions. Interpretation of test results must also consider unrelated anamnestic titres or asymptomatic infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics cures the disease in most patients, however some patients may not respond. The optimal drug has not yet been found. Best prophylaxis is by early removal of the tick from the skin. [References: 101]

AB  - Defensins are an important component of the innate immune system of ticks. These small peptides are produced by various genera of ticks, and expressed in various tissues. In this study we used RNA interference to silence the expression of the defensin varisin produced by the hemocytes of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. Ticks were injected with double stranded varisin RNA prior to being placed on a rabbit. After feeding, the ticks were removed, bled, and the hemolymph plasma and hemocytes separated. Hemocytes were screened for the presence (or absence) of both varisin transcript and peptide. Varisin peptide was below detectable levels and the transcript showed a greater than 99% knockdown. The antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph plasma was reduced 2-4 fold compared to that of control injected ticks indicating varisin accounts for a large portion of the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph.

AB  - Tick specimens removed from 48 dogs living in three counties (Arad, Bihor and Timis) of western Romania were collected between April 2010 and March 2012. Out of 258 collected ticks, 156 (60.4%) were identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 77 (29.8%) as Ixodes ricinus and 23 (8.91%) as Dermacentor reticulatus, respectively. Only two (0.77%) specimens were found as Haemaphysalis punctata. Regarding the dogs, 30 (62.5%) were parasitized only with I. ricinus, 9 (18.75%) animals were infested with R. sanguineus and 5 (10.41%) with D. reticulatus. H. punctata was found on one (2.08%) dog but on the same animal co-infestation with I. ricinus was recorded. Out of the tick species identified, some are known as reservoirs for specific pathogens, or are being involved in the spreading of different infections in animals and/or humans.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to investigate the cases with a tick bite in Moris Sinasi Children's Hospital between January 2007 and December 2010. We aimed to retrospectively determine the types of the tick, distribution of the cases according to months and years and personal characteristics of the cases. Materials and Methods: Total number of cases with tick bite in this period was 433. All withdrawn samples were put into alcohol and glycerine and examined under the light microscope. Demographic characteristics including residential areas of the patients, symptoms related to tick borne diseases of the patients and species and other characteristics of ticks removed from the subjects were investigated. Results: Of all 433 children, 182 (42%) were female and 251 (58%), male. In 285 (65.8%) of 433 tick bite suspected samples, various ectoparasites were detected microscopically. Removed ticks were classified in five genera. The overwhelmingly dominant genera were Hyalomma nymph and it comprised 54% of the collected samples. In terms of ages of children with tick bite suspected samples, 68 (15.7%) were 0-1 year old and accordingly 207 (47.8%) were 2-5 years old, 124 (28.6%) were 6-10 years old and 34 (7.9%) were 11-16 years old. Conclusion: Children are at risk for tick bites and tick-borne diseases, and therefore attention should be given, especially during the summer months.

AB  - Ticks are blood feeding external parasites of many different species, transmitting the widest variety of pathogens of any blood sucking arthropod and can cause diseases of varying degrees of seriousness to humans. These diseases are transmitted through their faeces, either by direct inoculation, transcutaneous or respiratory contamination. Wearing suitable clothes which completely cover the skin when walking in fields or woods is the best method of prevention against tick bites.The consequences of a bite can be limited by removing the tick as soon as possible.This must be carried out by carefully examining the skin of the person bitten; a tick bite is not painful and can only be found visually. Therapy can be carried out only after having the infection confirmed by immunological tests.the drugs then prescribed must be chosen carefully for their toxicity in the younger patients.

AB  - Accidental entry of insects and other arthropods is a common aetiology of aural foreign bodies (FB) presenting to accident and emergency departments. A retrospective study revealed that the FB in almost half (148) of 348 cases of aural FB investigated at the Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital was an arthropod. The most common arthropod encountered was the cockroach, followed by a cattle tick. The high prevalence of tick infestation of the human ear canal (i.e. human otoacariasis) currently appears to be unique to the Malaysian state of Kelantan. The presentation of patients with intra-aural ticks, the methods used to remove the ticks, the complications encountered, and recommendations for an appropriate course of action in such cases are discussed.

AB  - Accidental entry of insects and other arthropods is a common aetiology of aural foreign bodies (FB) presenting to accident and emergency departments. A retrospective study revealed that the FB in almost half (148) of 348 cases of aural FB investigated at the Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital was an arthropod. The most common arthropod encountered was the cockroach, followed by a cattle tick. The high prevalence of tick infestation of the human ear canal (i.e. human otoacariasis) currently appears to be unique to the Malaysian state of Kelantan. The presentation of patients with intra-aural ticks, the methods used to remove the ticks, the complications encountered, and recommendations for an appropriate course of action in such cases are discussed.

AB  - A retrospective study revealed that the foreign bodies in almost half (148) of 348 cases of aural foreign bodies investigated at the otolaryngology or accident and emergency departments of the Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital, Kelantan, Malaysia, in 1990-96 was an arthropod. The most common arthropods encountered were cockroaches (31% of cases), followed by ixodid ticks (21%), with beetles, ants, bugs, flies, bees, mosquitoes, maggots and lice also being encountered, as well as a leech and a snail. The high prevalence of tick infestation of the human ear canal (i.e. human otoacariasis) currently appears to be unique to Kelantan. The presentation of patients with intra-aural ticks, the methods used to remove the ticks, the complications encountered, and recommendations for an appropriate course of action in such cases are discussed.

AB  - Scanning electron microscopes (SEM), which image sample surfaces by scanning with an electron beam, are widely used for steric observations of resting samples in basic and applied biology. Various conventional methods exist for SEM sample preparation. However, conventional SEM is not a good tool to observe living organisms because of the associated exposure to high vacuum pressure and electron beam radiation. Here we attempted SEM observations of live ticks. During 1.5*10 -3 Pa vacuum pressure and electron beam irradiation with accelerated voltages (2-5 kV), many ticks remained alive and moved their legs. After 30-min observation, we removed the ticks from the SEM stage; they could walk actively under atmospheric pressure. When we tested 20 ticks (8 female adults and 12 nymphs), they survived for two days after SEM observation. These results indicate the resistance of ticks against SEM observation. Our second survival test showed that the electron beam, not vacuum conditions, results in tick death. Moreover, we describe the reaction of their legs to electron beam exposure. These findings open the new possibility of SEM observation of living organisms and showed the resistance of living ticks to vacuum condition in SEM. These data also indicate, for the first time, the usefulness of tick as a model system for biology under extreme condition.

AB  - Objective: The objectives of this study are to: (1) enhance the public's access to prophylaxis for Lyme disease following an identified Ixodes scapularis bite through pharmacist-initiated antibiotic therapy; and (2) assess patient satisfaction with the pharmacy-based service provided. Methods: Under a collaborative practice agreement with an infectious disease specialist physician, trained pharmacists at an independent pharmacy may identify patients eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis following attachment and removal of an I. scapularis tick and dispense a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline. Inclusion criteria include: adults 18 years of age or older; ability to provide informed consent; estimated time of tick attachment of at least 36 hours; tick removal within 72 hours of visit to pharmacy; absence of contraindications to doxycycline therapy; and reliable telephone access for follow-up assessments. Counseling provided to patient at the time of doxycycline dispensing includes: proper dosing and administration of doxycycline, potential medication adverse events and management of adverse effects, signs and symptoms of Lyme disease and when to seek medical attention; and methods to reduce risk of subsequent tick exposure. Pharmacists document each patient's participation and contact the medical provider listed on the collaborative agreement within 7 days of enrollment. Patients are contacted by phone 30 days after visit for a follow-up assessment using a standardized questionnaire including patient self-report of: adverse effects or concerns related to doxycycline treatment; signs or symptoms of Lyme disease that may have developed; results of blood tests or provider visits for suspected Lyme disease; and patient satisfaction with the pharmacist encounter and overall experience.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the percentage of ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi on the Dutch North Sea island of Ameland, and the risk of developing Lyme disease following tick bite on the island. Design. Prospective, observational. Method. Ticks were collected from patients who visited a general practitioner and were tested for the DNA of B. burgdorferi. After 6 months the patients were interviewed by phone using a standardised questionnaire. Results. From 2004-2006, 216 ticks were collected from 167 persons. Most ticks were removed within 24 hours. In 44 ticks (20.4%) B. burgdorferi DNA was detected. Follow up information was available on 146 persons, 41 (28.1%) of whom had been bitten by a Borrelia-positive tick. None of the persons developed a typical erythema migrans. From the 13 persons (9%) reporting a non-specific redness of the skin (diameter less than 5 cm) at the site of the tick bite, 5 had been bitten by a positive tick and 8 by a negative tick. One patient bitten by a positive tick reported systemic symptoms related to Lyme borreliosis, namely fatigue, perspiration and joint ache, without local redness. Conclusion. The probability of developing Lyme borreliosis was low even though a relatively large percentage of the ticks collected were positive for B. burgdorferi. This is probably connected to the fact that in the majority of cases the tick had been removed within 24 hours.

AB  - In this correspondence, a case is reported of a female adult wild-living European hedgehog ( Erinaceus europaeus) with ataxia and hypothermia on a private ground in Northern Germany. Attached ticks were removed, anthelmintic drugs (flubendazole and levamisole) were applied, and food and water were provided. No improvement in the animal's condition was noted and 24 days later, the hedgehog became somnolent and died. Necropsy revealed a poor body condition: the lung showed a mottled surface, the liver and kidneys were congested, the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and the bone marrow was of red colour and haematopoietically active. Histopathology revealed severe disseminated granulomatous inflammation predominantly affecting the spleen, liver and lungs. Numerous oval-shaped microorganisms 2-5 m in size were demonstrated within activated macrophages in raspberry-like clusters in the spleen, liver, lung, bone marrow, and lymph nodes and in lower numbers in the myocardium and kidney. These microorganisms were detectable using the Periodic Acid Schiff-reaction, Giemsa- and Grocott's methamine silver stain. Electron microscopy revealed microorganisms consisting of large nuclei and complex organized cytoplasmic organelles surrounded by an electron-lucent wall, which is in accordance with the ultrastructure of the Histoplasma capsulatum yeast cell. DNA was extracted from frozen tissue and applied to two nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) targeting the 18S rDNA (231 base pairs) and the gene encoding the specific 100 kDa-like protein (210 base pairs) of H. capsulatum, as described previously. The obtained PCR products were sequenced and aligned to the two sequences of H. capsulatum in GenBank, resulting in complete identity (accession number: X58572) and more than 98% homology (accession number: AJ005963). Although the aetiological fungus was not cultured, disseminated histoplasmosis in the hedgehog was diagnosed based on histopathology, electron microscopy and PCR.

AB  - During the IVth International Conference on Lyme Borreliosis in Stockholm, 1990, a workshop on control of Lyme disease vectors briefly reviewed: basic ecological principles for tick control; biocontrol of ticks; chemical control, including the use of repellents and use of permethrin-treated rodent nest material; tick control by habitat modification; and reduction of tick host availability. It was concluded that, although much research work remains, Lyme borreliosis is to a large extent a preventable infection. Avoidance of heavily tick-infested areas, personal protection using proper clothing, and prompt removal of attached ticks remain the most effective protective measures. Many other prophylactic measures are available and could be efficiently integrated into schemes to reduce the abundance of vectors. However, since the ecology of the infection varies greatly between different localities it may be necessary to apply different combinations of control methods in different endemic regions.

AB  - The seasonality of I. ricinus was studied by three daily consecutive flaggings in four sites situated in an ecotone between a spruce forest and a peaty meadow, a spruce forest, a beech forest and a dense spruce forest in Denmark. First day flagging samples represent the most commonly used method for description of tick seasonality. Since two consecutive flaggings remove ticks in the vegetation, third day flagging samples represent the number of ticks ascending into the vegetation, which was interpreted as being closely related to the size of the free living tick population. First day samples of nymphs were reasonably consistent with the typical bimodal seasonal pattern of activity. Third day samples showed a more stable seasonal development with no or only limited bimodality. The host seeking period or retention time in the vegetation, as defined by the ratio between first and third day samples differed within the season. The host seeking periods were found to be long in the spring, short in midsummer and intermediate in autumn. By analysing the host seeking period for dependency of weather parameters, it was found that host seeking periods primarily depend on relative humidity and solar radiation. No significant difference in tick abundance in third day samples could be related to weather conditions.

AB  - A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect and quantify a portion of the outer membrane protein B gene ( ompB) of Rickettsia amblyommii was employed to assess the threat of R. amblyommii exposure to humans parasitized by Amblyomma americanum (the lone star tick). A total of 72 pools of lone star ticks removed from humans were acquired from two collections and used in this study: 44 pools of A. americanum submitted to the Department of Defense Human Tick Test Kit Program in 2003 collected from 220 individuals from 14 states, and 28 pools of A. americanum representing 120 ticks obtained from boy scouts and adult leaders at the Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, in 2005. Of the 72 lone star tick pools representing 340 lone star ticks, 58 pools (80.5%) were positive for R. amblyommii. In addition, individual A. americanum ticks parasitizing humans collected as part of the Department of Defense Human Tick Test Kit Program in 2002 and 2003 from 17 states were evaluated. It was found that 244 of 367 (66.5%) individual A. americanum ticks tested positive for the presence of R. amblyommii DNA. These results clearly show that lone star ticks parasitizing humans are highly infected with R. amblyommii, which may potentiate rickettsial infection of and possibly disease in humans.

AB  - Background: Tickborne diseases are the most common vectorborne illnesses in the United States. Understanding risk factors for tick bites and adherence to preventive measures are important in preventing morbidity associated with tickborne disease. Methods: A random-digit-dialing telephone survey was administered to 1820 residents of 11 counties in Tennessee. Results: Of respondents, 16.4% reported a tick bite within the previous year. Only 29% consistently used insect repellant in high-risk situations, and only 54% always checked their bodies for ticks after leaving potentially infested areas. Nearly one fourth of dog owners removed ticks from their pets with bare hands. Dog ownership, rural residence, and exposure to a farm were associated with increased risk of tick bites. Conclusions: We identified several groups that were at increased risk of tick bites and might benefit from targeted prevention messages. © 2002 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB  - The phylum Arthropoda includes arachnids and insects. Although their bites typically cause only local reactions, some species are venomous or transmit disease. The two medically important spiders in the United States are widow spiders (Latrodectus), the bite of which causes intense muscle spasms, and the brown recluse (Loxosceles), which may cause skin necrosis. Widow bites usually respond to narcotics, benzodiazepines, or, when necessary, antivenom. Most recluse bites resolve uneventfully without aggressive therapy and require only wound care and minor debridement. Tick bites can transmit diseases only after prolonged attachment to the host. Treatment of clothing with permethrin and proper tick removal greatly reduce the risk of infection. Ticks of medical importance in the United States include the black-legged tick, the Lone Star tick, and the American dog tick. The prophylactic use of a single dose of doxycycline for Lyme disease may be justified in high-risk areas of the country when an attached, engorged black-legged tick is removed. Bites from fleas, bedbugs, biting flies, and mosquitoes present as nonspecific pruritic pink papules, but the history and location of the bite can assist with diagnosis. Flea bites are usually on ankles, whereas mosquito bites are on exposed skin, and chigger bites tend to be along the sock and belt lines. Antihistamines are usually the only treatment required for insect bites; however, severe mosquito reactions (skeeter syndrome) may require prednisone. Applying insect repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) 10% to 35% or picaridin 20% is the best method for preventing bites.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the risk of B. burgdorferi s.l. transmission by I. ricinus-nymphs to a host (i) after different periods of feeding, and (ii) with regard to the particular method of tick removal. On each of 72 Mongolian gerbils, 3 tick nymphs taken from a highly infected batch were allowed to feed in a small capsule. Feeding ticks were removed 16.7, 28.9, 47.0 and 65.2 h post-attachment. In each of these 4 groups, 3 sub-groups with 6 gerbils each were deticked by (a) pulling ticks out with forceps without any pretreatment, (b) pulling ticks out after 3 min of intensive squeezing, and (c) applying nail polish to ticks 1.1 h before removal. The infection status in each gerbil was subsequently determined by larval xenodiagnosis. All gerbils with ticks removed ≥ 47 h post-attachment were found to be infected. After 16.7 h, as well as after 28.9 h, of tick feeding, ~50% of the gerbils had acquired a transmissible infection, thus B. burgdorferi transmission to a host may even occur in the early phases of I. ricinus feeding. There is no evidence from this study that the tick removal method used has any significant influence on a host's infection risk.

AB  - A three-year-old girl presented with a small brown lesion on the right upper eyelid margin. Close examination revealed an insect body attached to the eyelid margin. Microscopic examination of the specimen identified the species of the organism as Ixodes ricinus. The tick was completely removed with blunt forceps. She was treated with lid toilet, irrigation, and application of topical 0.3% ciprofloxacin four times daily to the affected eye. The lesion healed without scarring after one week. No systemic symptoms were observed. Mechanical removal with blunt forceps may be a quick, easy, safe and effective treatment for ticks located on the eyelids.

AB  - Laboratory animal medicine professionals are often required to develop husbandry practices for species not commonly considered for use as laboratory animals. Although protocols exist for management of captive white-tailed deer in an outdoor facility, it was necessary to modify those procedures to house fawns in an indoor facility. Four abandoned fawns were acquired through a cooperative effort with the Department of Conservation. Physical examinations were performed and fecal samples were collected when the 2- to 3-day-old fawns arrived at the facility. All fawns were infested with ticks, which were removed manually. After quarantine of 24 to 48 h, the fawns were moved to large chain-link pens and housed in pairs. Rubber mats covered with wood shavings provided secure footing, and a large portable kennel was used to provide shelter and concealment. Milk replacer formulated for goats was fed via a bottle at regularly scheduled intervals according to the expected caloric needs determined on the basis of body weight of each fawn. Water, hay, and alfalfa pellets were available ad libitum. All fawns gained weight at a steady rate during the 4-month study, with a mean weight gain of 150 g/d. Blood collection was performed at the conclusion of the study to establish reference values for 3- to 4-month-old white-tailed deer fawns. Manual restraint for clinical procedures was sufficient initially, but when the fawns grew too large to handle easily, a combination of ketamine hydrochloride-xylazine hydrochloride was used for sedation. The methods employed were successful for short-term maintenance of the fawns in an indoor facility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Discuss clinical and radiological manifestations of acute LNB. BACKGROUND: LNB may appear during early or late-stage systemic involvement. Prompt clinical diagnosis and treatment reduces long-term morbidity. Early systemic inflammatory and immunological markers are unpredictable and misleading. Authors describe clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of early-disseminated Lyme disease with neurological involvement. DESIGN/METHODS: A 46-year-old patient presented with new onset right facial weakness. Patient had presented with painful lumbosacral myeloradiculopathic symptoms, fever, neck pain, 7-cm-oval-erythematous lesion in right groin 10 days earlier and was receiving prednisone. Patient was afebrile without skin lesions, reported tick removal 2 years prior but not recently. Examination was remarkable for right Bell's palsy and hyperreflexia without limb weakness or sphincter involvement. MRI-brain was normal, MRI-spine showed T2-hyperintensity within spinal cord extending from T-8 to conus medullaris without abnormal enhancement. Diagnostic spinal-tap revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (WBC: 491), high protein (183), IgG index (0.99), >5 well-defined {gamma}-restriction bands; negative Lyme disease DNA PCR, viral, fungal, and bacterial studies, and normal angiotensin converting enzyme levels. NMO antibodies were negative. Lyme disease serology showed positive IgG and IgM antibodies with IgM antibody index of 7.21 and IgG/IgM antibody index of 12.0. RESULTS: Diagnosis of acute LNB was considered, patient was given 2-gram intravenous ceftriaxone daily for 28-days, which resolved symptoms. Neurological examination normalized by the end of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Though there were no Lyme DNA or antibodies identified in CSF, negative-history of prior neuroborreliosis, positive serum anti-Borrelia antibody index and absence of other etiological explanations for symptoms but a favorable outcome after antibiotic treatment confirmed that the patient had LNB. Unpredictable inflammatory and immunological response to B. burgdorferi makes a quick and practical bedside diagnosis and management of neuroborreliosis difficult for clinicians: controversies exist despite top quality clinical research in this field. This case report illustrates a clinician's approach towards the management of acute neuroborreliosis.

AB  - Background: Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has never been isolated from a patient thought to have acquired Lyme disease in any southeastern state. Objective: To investigate 14 cases of an erythema migrans (EM)-like rash illness that occurred during 2 summers at an outdoor camp in central North Carolina in an effort to determine the etiologic, epidemiological, and clinical aspects of this illness. Methods: Using active surveillance, we identified cases of clinically diagnosed EM in residents and staff of the camp. We collected clinical and demographic information; history of exposure to ticks; acute and convalescent serum antibodies to B burgdorferi, Rickettsia rickettsii, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis; and cultures for spirochetes from biopsy specimens of skin lesions. Serum samples from a group of residents and staff who did not develop rashes were tested for the same antibodies. We speciated ticks removed from people and collected from vegetation. Results: We identified 14 cases of EM-like rash illness during the 2 summers. Of the 14 case-patients, 10 had associated mild systemic symptoms and 1 had documented fever. All 14 case-patients had removed attached ticks, and 8 remembered having removed a tick from the site where the rash developed a median of 12 days earlier (range, 2-21 days). One tick removed from the site where a rash later developed was identified as Amblyomma americanum, the Lone Star tick: 97% of ticks collected from vegetation and 95% of ticks removed from people were A americanum. No spirochetes were isolated from skin biopsy specimens. Paired serum samples from 13 case-patients did not show diagnostic antibody responses to B burgdorferi or other tick-borne pathogens. Conclusions: This investigation suggests the existence of a new tick-associated rash illness. We suspect that the disease agent is carried by A americanum ticks. In the southern United States, EM-like rash illness should no longer be considered definitive evidence of early Lyme disease.

AB  - The removal of attached adults of Amblyomma americanum (L.) is difficult, and the mouth-parts are often left embedded in the skin of the host [ cf. R.A.E, B 33 86]. During studies to find easy methods of removing embedded ticks, a device was developed for measuring the force required to detach them. An embedded tick was attached with thread to the end of an aluminium bar mounted on a knife edge, and by pulling a weighted, free-rolling axle along the marked top of the bar away from the tick, progressively increasing force was applied and, when the tick became detached from the host, the position of the axle on the bar was recorded; pulls equivalent to 7-220 g. could be exerted. Although the hypostomes of males were shorter than those of females and significantly less force was needed to detach the former than the latter, tests with the sexes separated showed that the force needed did not increase significantly with increases in hypo-stomal length. The effectiveness of 31 materials in reducing the force required to remove treated, wild-caught ticks attached to the ears of rabbits was evaluated by treating the ticks with the material as a drench, a swab or an aerosol; a number of the materials (13 in the case of the female ticks) reduced the average pull by half or more than half that needed to remove the untreated ticks. Deodorised kerosene, camphorated phenol (250 g. phenol with 750 g. camphor made up to 2, 000 ml. with heavy petroleum jelly), propyl N, N-diethylsuccinamate, 3-chloropropylnoctyl sulphoxide, a mixture containing 1.2 per cent. pyrethrins and 6 per cent. piperonyl butoxide, 2-hydroxypropyln-octyl sulfide, 1 per cent. pyrethrins in ethanol, a mixture of 0.2 per cent. pyrethrins, 2 per cent. synergist and 97.8 per cent. deodorised kerosene, Indalone, 20 per cent. pyrethrum extract and 1, 1-dimethyl-3-(p-acetamidophenyl)triazene caused voluntary detachment, the first two in about 25 per cent. of the ticks treated. The degree of attachment of ticks to the backs of rabbits or guineapigs was comparable to their attachment to the human leg; considerably more force was required to remove them from these sites than from the ears of rabbits.

AB  - Erythema migrans has been described as "pathognomonic" for early Lyme borreliosis. Mediterranean spotted fever, also transmitted by ticks, is a febrile illness with generalized rash, although few cases are "spotless". Here we present a case with Erythema migrans-Hke lesion with serological evidence of Rickettsia conori and transitory anti Borrelia burgdorferi seropositivity. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital in March 2000 with a 2-day history of low-grade fever and rash on her popliteal fossa. An engorged tick was removed from the same place, later identified as Demacentor marginatus. The rash resolved after 15 days of oral doxycycline. Three probable explanations have been discussed. Erythema migrans should not be considered pathognomonic for early Lyme borreliosis. To further establish Rickettsia conori as aethiologic agent of Erythema migrans-like lesion culture and PCR technique are strongly recommended.

AB  - A study on prevention of borreliosis in humans bitten by infected ticks was performed in 1992-1994 in the Perm' region of Russia. Adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks were removed from the study subjects, and live preparations made from the material obtained from the gut of each tick were microscopically analyzed (up to 250 microscopic fields per preparation). Persons were divided into experimental and control groups (261 and 97 persons, respectively). The experimental group received doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for 3-5 days after the tick bite. In the control (untreated) group, 12 persons contracted borreliosis. In the experimental group, the disease was diagnosed in three subjects. Morbidity per 100 patients in the experimental group was 1.1, i.e. 11 times lower than that in the control group. Identification of Borrelia in ticks by microscopic analysis, followed by a short-term treatment with antibiotics according to microbiological indications, is an efficient method for preventing persons from contracting borreliosis.

AB  - Objective: Cases of tick bite require careful assessment because Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an increasingly important tick-borne disease in Turkey. The aim of this study is to analyse the patients who applied to the hospital for a tick bite and to determine the prevalence of tick bites in the Bolu Province according to the records of the Provincial Directorate of Health. Methods: The charts of the patients admitted to the Emergency Department between 1 January 2007 and 31 July 2010 were reviewed. The locations where the tick attached to the patient, site of the tick bite on the body, dates of tick bite and removal of the tick as well as the demographic characteristics were recorded. Moreover, data of the Provincial Directorate of Health on total number of tick bites, confirmed CCHF cases and deaths due to CCHF in the Bolu Province during the study period were evaluated. Results: A total of 451 patients were admitted to the Emergency Department, and 52.5% were female. The mean age was 41.7 years. The cases were predominantly observed in June and July, and were mostly from the city center (n=216) and the majority of them (n=338) were found to take place in the patients' primary living area. For patients in some professional groups such as labourers, officials and retired persons, the difference between male and female patients was statistically significant in terms of incurring a tick bite. According to the records of the whole province during the study period, 10 979 patients had a tick bite, 72 were diagnosed as CCHF, and 6 patients had a fatal outcome. Conclusions: Contact with a tick is a hazardous condition and precautions such as development of public awareness, preventive measures and education of the healthcare staff is crucial.

AB  - Objective: Cases of tick bite require careful assessment because Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an increasingly important tick-borne disease in Turkey. The aim of this study is to analyse the patients who applied to the hospital for a tick bite and to determine the prevalence of tick bites in the Bolu Province according to the records of the Provincial Directorate of Health. Methods: The charts of the patients admitted to the Emergency Department between 1 January 2007 and 31 July 2010 were reviewed. The locations where the tick attached to the patient, site of the tick bite on the body, dates of tick bite and removal of the tick as well as the demographic characteristics were recorded. Moreover, data of the Provincial Directorate of Health on total number of tick bites, confirmed CCHF cases and deaths due to CCHF in the Bolu Province during the study period were evaluated. Results: A total of 451 patients were admitted to the Emergency Department, and 52.5% were female. The mean age was 41.7 years. The cases were predominantly observed in June and July, and were mostly from the city center (n=216) and the majority of them (n=338) were found to take place in the patients' primary living area.

AB  - The effect of biweekly flagging on adult I. pacificus abundance was determined in Contra Costa County, California, USA, by using mark-recapture techniques. Ticks were recaptured up to 3 times during the 12-week study, and increasingly higher proportions of marked ticks were recaptured as the study progressed. By week 6 of the study, 46% of the collected ticks had been marked, and on the final sampling date, all ticks had been captured previously. Removal sampling would have substantially reduced estimates of the abundance of the questing I. pacificus adult population. For ecological studies that require the repeated sampling of a given habitat, the most representative data are obtained by returning flagged ticks to their collection site.

AB  - Three German patients aged 28, 31 and 40 years developed fever following a period of residence in the Mediterranean region (Portugal, Spain and Sicily). Two of the patients also complained of headaches and one developed myalgia, arthralgia and vomiting. Two of the patients (cases 2 and 3) had been accompanied by their dogs; one was bitten by a tick and the other reported removing ticks from her dogs. Two patients (cases 1 and 2) were severely ill and presented with high fever and generalized maculopapular rash which included the soles and palms; cases 2 and 3 had skin lesions. All 3 patients showed an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated liver enzyme levels. Cases 1 and 2 presented with a significantly elevated activity of lactate dehydrogenase, leukocyturia and microhaematuria. Indirect immunofluorescent assay for anti- Rickettsia conorii antibodies revealed titres between 1:40 and 1:640. Diagnosis of Mediterranean spotted fever was based on clinical aspects and epidemiological data. Case 1 had been treated with penicillin for 2 days without success; parenteral administration of ciprofloxacin caused complete defervescence and clinical improvement within 2 days. Complete defervescence within 2 days was achieved in case 2 with doxycycline. Case 3 was mild and the patient defervesced spontaneously. Mediterranean spotted fever should be considered in cases of fever and rash following a visit to the Mediterranean region in summer. The presence of a skin lesion may confirm the diagnosis. Early treatment may shorten the course of the disease and prevent complications.

AB  - Objective: Tick-borne diseases and especially Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) are serious epidemiological problems in many parts of the world. In this study, we aimed to emphasize the importance of an emergency approach to treat these diseases and to stress the importance of identifying characteristics of patients who are admitted to the hospital for tick attachment. Material and Methods: This study included 336 patients who admitted to Uludag University Medical Faculty Hospital Emergency Department (ED) and presented with tick attachment between April 2009 and May 2010. Patient demographics, clinical and laboratory findings and follow-up data were recorded. Laboratory parameters of hospitalized patients and non- hospitalized patients were statistically compared. Results: The mean age of the patients was 43.85(plus or minus)13.88 years. Males comprised %50.9 of the patients. The most common months for hospital admission for tick attachment were July (33.0%) and August (32.4%). Of total, %49.1 of the patients acquired the tick in urban areas while %35.4 of them acquired it in the rural areas such as picnic areas, forest, field or animal shelters. The tick attachments were found in the lower extremities in 27.4% of the patients. In 65.5% of patients, the tick was removed by a physician in the ED using a forceps (54.2%) which was the most commonly used tool for tick removal. Laboratory parameters [aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CK), white blood cell, neutrophil and platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the international normalized ratio (INR)] of the hospitalized patients who were suspected CCHF were statistically significantly different when compared to the ones who were not hospitalized. Conclusion: In tick attachment cases who admitted to the ED, decreased levels of thrombocyte, leukocyte and neutrophil counts and increased levels of AST, ALT, LDH, CK, aPTT, PT and INR are significant for CCHF. An emergency department physician should be alert for these results. (copyright) 2013 by Turkiye Klinikleri.

AB  - A description is given of a simple device developed in the Soviet Union for transporting Ixodid ticks from the field to the laboratory. It consists essentially of a band of cloth (such as calico), 150-160 cm X 6.3 cm, wound on two film spools (from a still camera) mounted quite closely together on a special stand. Ticks collected during dragging or by other means are transferred to the exposed cloth on the receiving spool and then the cloth with the ticks attached is wound on to the other spool. This is unwound in the laboratory for removal of the ticks. Examples of Ixodes persulcatus Schulze, H[aemaphy salis] condnna Koch and H. japonica Warb, remained alive in the roll of cloth, which was moistened regularly, for an observation period of 14 days.

AB  - Rates of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi were compared in adult Ixodes dammini ticks collected from deer at one coastal and two island sites with those collected from vegetation at the same sites. Ticks were examined using polyclonal direct fluorescent antibody. Spirochetes were observed in 47% of 288 ticks from vegetation as opposed to 13% of 276 ticks from deer (χ2, P &lt; .001). This disparity was increased when only male ticks were compared. Among female ticks from deer, the infection rate was higher in flat than in engorged ticks. These findings may reflect spirochete loss from ingestion of borreliacidal antibodies in deer blood or may result from factors related to the sensitivity of direct fluorescent antibody methods. They indicate that erroneously low estimates of regional risk for Lyme disease may be obtained if ticks removed from deer are included in the determination of tick infection rates.

AB  - The usefulness of subcutaneous injection of three local anesthetic agents to stimulate tick detachment in an animal model was evaluated. American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) were placed on three New Zealand white rabbits and allowed to attach for 24 hours. Dead and unattached ticks were manually removed. Three local anesthetic agents were studied: 1% lidocaine (group A); 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 (group B); and 1% chloroprocaine (group C). For each group, a total of 0.25 mL of anesthetic agent was injected subcutaneously under the attached portion of each tick, resulting in formation of a 5- to 6-mm wheal. For all three anesthetic agents studied (group A, 34 ticks; group B, 28 ticks; group C, 31 ticks), none of the ticks spontaneously detached within 1 hour after injection. Subcutaneous injection of 1% lidocaine, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, and 1% chloroprocaine are not effective methods for rapid tick removal in the animal model.

AB  - Research into tick-borne diseases implies vector sampling and the detection and identification of microbial pathogens. Ticks were collected simultaneously from dogs that had been exposed to tick bites and by flagging the ground in the area in which the dogs had been exposed. In total, 200 ticks were sampled, of which 104 came from dogs and 96 were collected by flagging. These ticks were subsequently examined for DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp. and Babesia canis. A mixed sample of adult ticks and nymphs of Ixodes ricinus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) and Haemaphysalis concinna (Ixodida: Ixodidae) was obtained by flagging. Female I. ricinus and adult Dermacentor reticulatus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) ticks dominated the engorged ticks removed from dogs. Rickettsia spp. were detected in 17.0% of the examined ticks, A. phagocytophilum in 3.5%, B. canis in 1.5%, and B. burgdorferi s.l. in 16.0%. Ticks with multiple infections were found only among the flagging sample. The ticks removed from the dogs included 22 infected ticks, whereas the flagging sample included 44 infected ticks. The results showed that the method for collecting ticks influences the species composition of the sample and enables the detection of a different pattern of pathogens. Sampling strategies should be taken into consideration when interpreting studies on tick-borne pathogens.

AB  - Lyme arthritis in dogs can be induced under experimental and natural conditions. However, the veterinary relevance of canine borreliosis is still under extensive investigation. The prevalence of symptoms is clearly low, although the risk of tick exposure is high. Current research focuses on case definitions, methods for diagnosing clinical disease in dogs, and discrimination between an immune response to a natural infection and an immune response to vaccination. In this experimental study, 23 dogs raised under tick-free conditions were allocated to two groups. The 11 dogs in the first group were vaccinated with a commercial borrelia vaccine and subsequently developed detectable antibody titers. The 12 dogs in the second group were walked on two consecutive days in an area where ticks were endemic. On day 5 after exposure, engorged ticks were removed from the 12 dogs and were analyzed for Borrelia DNA by a real-time PCR assay. Blood samples were taken before exposure/vaccination and at defined time points thereafter. Antibody responses were evaluated using an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and Western blotting. Seven dogs from which Borrelia-positive ticks were removed seroconverted and developed individual immune responses. Blood and urine samples taken from the tick-exposed group at weeks 1 and 3 for real-time PCR analysis and culture were always negative for bacterial DNA. In conclusion, despite serological evidence of infection/immunization, no clinical signs of disease were observed. The antibody patterns in a single Western blot did not permit differentiation between the different antigen sources (vaccine versus natural infection). However, repeated Western blot analyses may be useful for the confirmation of infection or vaccination status, since the time courses of the levels of specific antibodies seem to be different.

AB  - To identify risk factors for incident Lyme disease in California during the period June 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992, the authors compared the activities of 101 cases of physician-diagnosed erythema migrans ascertained via both active and passive surveillance with those of 107 controls matched on sex, age, and neighborhood. Questions asked by telephone pertained to location of home, presence of wildlife around the house, hours of outdoor work and outdoor leisure activities, pet ownership, precautionary measures to avoid tick bites, tick removal methods, and knowledge about Lyme disease. For cases, activities pertained to the month prior to the onset of erythema migrans; controls were interviewed about the same activities during the same one-month period. The observation of deer and lizards around the home and a history of exposure to ticks were associated with Lyme disease (deer, odds ratio (OR) = 2.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-5.15; lizards, OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.14-4.04). However, the only activity associated with Lyme disease was the use for more than 5 hours per week of wide maintained trails (OR = 11.33, 95% CI 1.33-123.5); this association occurred only in persons with other outdoor leisure activities. No other behaviors or activities were identified as risk factors for acquisition of Lyme disease in California.

AB  - This report describes two cases of tick paralysis in children diagnosed within a 3-month period (May-July 2002) in rural South Carolina. Differing presenting symptoms consisted of acute onset of ataxia in one patient and acute ascending paralysis in the other. Ticks were present on the scalp of both patients and were removed immediately. Both girls demonstrated improvement of signs and symptoms within hours and complete recovery within 24 hours of tick removal. The diagnosis of tick paralysis must be considered in any patient, particularly children, who present with either acute ataxia or acute ascending paralysis. As in any clinical encounter, careful history and thorough general and neurologic examinations must be performed to exclude the possibility of tick attachment. [References: 18]

AB  - Background: Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) undermine cattle fitness and productivity in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria. The aim of this study was to document the composition of tick species, assessing the burden of infestation, in traditionally managed cattle in an area of central Nigeria where acaricides have not been used historically. Methods: The study was carried out in September 2010 in 9 villages belonging to three neighbouring local government areas in Plateau State, Nigeria. In each village all visible adult ticks were collected from at least 15 cattle (mean number=25). Collected ticks were preserved in 70% ethanol to be counted and morphologically identified to the species level. Results: A total of 5011 ixodid ticks (1935 males and 3076 females) were collected from 228 cattle, comprising 14 calves, 33 juveniles, and 181 adults. Three tick genera (i.e., Amblyomma, Hyalomma, and Rhipicephalus, including the Boophilus sub-genus) and 11 species were identified. The most prevalent species was Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus) decoloratus (41.4%), followed by Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus) annulatus (15.4%), Rhipicephalus guilhoni (12.0%), Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus) geigyi (7.6%), Hyalomma truncatum (7.4%), Amblyomma variegatum (6.3%), Rhipicephalus simus Group (4.0%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (1.2%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus (0.3%), Hyalomma rufipes (0.2%), and Rhipicephalus lunulatus (n=1). Mean tick loads recorded were relatively high (221.4), in spite of the practice of hand removal of ticks traditionally undertaken by the Fulani pastoralists in the area. Calves bore a significantly lower tick burden than adults (p=0.004). Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus) microplus was not found in the area, suggesting that the eastbound expansion of this tick species in West Africa, has not yet reached central Nigeria. Conclusions: This study ascertained the presence of a broad variety of cattle tick species, most of which are of veterinary importance. The presence of each tick species is correlated with the potential occurrence of tick-borne pathogens and suggestions for tick control in the area are considered. Results should assist the diagnosis of related TBDs in cattle as well as the strategic planning of cost-effective tick control.

AB  - The authors summarize the literature with regard to the detection of flagellates in ticks. Of six ticks removed from a dog suffering from leishmaniasis (cutaneous) two were found by examination of sections to contain flagellates. Careful examination and cultivation of the dog's blood yielded no evidence of trypanosome infection. Inoculation experiments also failed At post-mortem no evidence of trypano-somiasis or leishmaniasis could be found in the dog. It appears to be probable that the flagellate was derived from some other host, and also that it was identical with Crithidia Christophersi.

AB  - In this bulletin, a somewhat popular account is given of the bionomics of Ixodes ricinus, L., an important parasite of sheep in Britain [ cf. R.A.E., B 20 274], together with information on its relation to louping ill [ cf. 20 266] and tick-borne fever [ cf. 24 249]. Methods of control are discussed. It is suggested that in cases where ordinary sheep-farming methods are not practised and the primary consideration is the removal of the ticks, the sheep should be dipped at short intervals throughout the tick season (mid-March to the end of May) in a derris wash or some other preparation that may be used repeatedly without harming them. On sheep farms where it is desirable to increase the farm profits without interfering too greatly with the normal sequence of farming activities, especially during the busy lambing season, which coincides with the tick season, it is suggested that the sheep be dipped in one of the special preparations now available that will protect them from re-infestation for 2-3 weeks after its application; the two main dippings (one of which is carried out immediately before lambing begins and the other about three weeks later) may be augmented by one or two supplementary dippings, according to circumstances. For farms where profitable farming is impossible unless ticks are eradicated, a scheme combining starvation of the ticks with serial dipping of the sheep is recommended [ cf. 21 203].

AB  - Much of the information contained in this brief account of the bionomics, economic importance and control of Dermacentor andersoni, Stiles, in Canada has already been noticed from other sources [ cf. R.A.E., B 25 178, 179; 27 172; 28 143]. It is the most important of the 22 species of ticks that have been found in Canada because of its relation to disease (Rocky Mountain spotted fever in man and tularaemia and tick paralysis in both man and domestic animals); it is also the tick that most commonly attacks man in western North America. It is distributed throughout the dry belt of British Columbia, and in southern Alberta and south-western Saskatchewan; it does not occur on the coast of British Columbia or in eastern Canada. The measures recommended for the control of ticks on live-stock include dipping three times at intervals of 10 days, beginning when the ticks first appear in spring; an effective dip is composed of 24 Ib. sodium carbonate, 8 Ib. white arsenic, 1 gal. pine tar oil and 500 gals, water. Where a dipping vat is not available and there are only a few animals, dipping fluids may be applied by means of a sprayer. For cattle, a dressing consisting of about 3 parts of raw cottonseed oil or raw linseed oil, mixed with 1 part pine tar oil, applied from the back of the head, along the neck, over the peak of the shoulders and half way along the back, will usually kill most of the attached ticks, prevent reinfestation for some time and help to repel the attacks of blowflies. On horses, ticks often attach themselves under the jaw, on the belly and between the hind legs; it is sometimes advisable to clip the mane before a dressing is applied, since numbers of ticks are sometimes found hidden under the long hair. Whenever possible, stock should be confined in fenced, tick-free pastures during the period of tick activity in the spring months from the latter part of March to the end of June. A method of poisoning rodents on which the immature ticks feed, the symptoms and treatment of tick paralysis and the way in which ticks should be removed from man are described.

AB  - In this report, we present basic data pertinent to the current understanding of borrelial infection in pregnancy, and propose a rationale for the management of Lyme borreliosis in pregnant women. We advocate early detection of attached ticks and their prompt removal. We do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in pregnant women but support the 'wait and watch' strategy, including early treatment with antibiotics if signs/symptoms of the disease arise. We encourage the approach that antibiotic treatment of pregnant patients is restricted to those having a reliable clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, and propose intravenous antibiotic treatment with penicillin, or preferably ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 14 days, not only for patients with early disseminated disease but also for those with solitary erythema migrans.

AB  - Symptoms of this condition are first noticed about 24 or 36 hours after horses have been admitted to infested land, which is usually covered with heather or broom. If the hand be passed over the animars body, indications of a dermatitis are obtained in the shape of pimples and oedematous patches. After a short time thick yellow scales are seen, and the hair becomes matted in tufts that easily come away when pulled, leaving an irregular smooth surface which is moist and painful. Adult male and unfertilized female ticks come away with the scabs, but most of the fertilized females, which are engorged and of enormous size, have their rostra firmly implanted beneath the skin and are only detached with difficulty. The ticks are found chiefly in places where the animal cannot reach them with its teeth (parotid region, jowl), or where the skin is fine (elbow, belly, inside the thigh and forearm). They are not usually present on the trunk above a horizontal line passing through the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the ribs, nor on the limbs below the middle of the forearm and gaskin. The irritation set up is very marked and the animals bite themselves freely. Some subjects become so nervous and excited that they are very difficult to approach. In severe cases there are numerous cutaneous lesions which, by confluence, become converted into large, hairless, irritable patches, that heal but slowly and are analogous to the effects of a strong blister. The lesions on the upper part of the limbs may cause marked oedema accompanied by lameness. Provided treatment is applied early, the lesions terminate rapidly without complications. Prompt attention should be given not only to prevent extensive damage to the skin, but also to ensure the destruction of the female ticks before they drop off in. readiness to lay their eggs. Complications may result in the shape of painful miliary abscesses in cases where the rostra are left under the skin after removal of the ticks by an attendant or by the horses' teeth. From the point of view of prevention, the possible infestation with ticks must be considered whenever horses are obliged to cross moory or waste land. In such cases it is advisable to wash the body over with a warm solution of cresyl, or to rub it with a sponge dipped in benzine and then rung out so as to contain only the vapour. A satisfactory curative method consists in sulphur fumigation. One passage of 30 minutes in the chamber is sufficient to completely free the animals of all the ticks they carry. In advanced cases attention to the lesions is necessary in addition. Eradication by hand is not recommended owing to the length of time involved and the difficulty experienced in extracting the ticks whole.

AB  - There are approximately twenty species of hard (ixodid) ticks worldwide that frequently affect human populations, many of which are associated with serious, sometimes fatal disease(s). When a tick travel souvenir is presented in the clinic, the risk must be immediately assessed by identifying the tick in question, ascertaining its disease vector status and determining if there has been the opportunity for the transfer of potential pathogens. This short review on identification of disease vector ticks and aspects of blood feeding and disease transmission includes the results of an examination of 59 specimens removed from UK domestic travellers and international travellers between 2002 and 2010. Sixteen tick species belonging to six genera were recorded and almost all showed evidence of blood feeding, which appears to contradict the view that because of their size, adult ticks are found early and therefore present an insignificant risk.

AB  - In an attempt to confirm the occurrence of. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (caused by Rickettsia rickettsi) in nature in small mammals in the Richmond area of Ontario, as suggested by serological tests in 1962, rabbits were exposed in cages in 1962-63 and ticks removed from them were examined for rickettsiae. This resulted in the isolation from Haemaphysalis leporispalustris (Pack.) of a strain of Rickettsia that was shown by complement-fixation tests to be a member of the typhus group, but distinct from R. prowazekli or R. mooseri ( typhi), and by neutralization tests to be a new species. The name R. Canada is proposed for it. Preliminary neutralization and complement-fixation tests suggested that a strain isolated from 16 engorged examples of H. leporispalustris from a snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus), shot in October 1964 about 20 miles south of the area in which the caged rabbits were exposed, was also R. canada. That this new member of the typhus group was isolated from a tick is of interest in the light of Reiss-Guttfreund's evidence that ticks [ RAE B 57 263] and domestic animals [45 202] may harbour R. prowazekii, which had hitherto been believed to be maintained only in a man-louse-man cycle.

AB  - A third species has been added to the typhus group of rickettsiae. This new rickettsia was isolated from Haemophysalis leporispalustris ticks removed from rabbits in Ontario. Inoculation of tick suspensions into chick embryos was the method of culture. Results of c.f. tests with g.pig, hamster, and rabbit antiserum showed that it was a member of the typhus group, while results with antiserum prepared in mice suggested that it was different from the two known species, Rickettsia typhi and R. prowazeki, in the group. Results of toxin neutralization tests furnished the final proof that this is a new species; the name Rickettsia Canada is proposed.

AB  - The risk of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato transmission from an infected vector tick to a host increases with increasing duration of tick feeding. In Ixodes ricinus nymphs, the main vector of B. burgdorferi s.l. in most parts of Europe, the transmission risk appears low to moderate within the first 24 h of feeding but increases to >70% after only 36 h. In this study, the so-called scutal index, the ratio between tick abdominal length and scutum width, a very good measure of the level of tick engorgement, was investigated for its potential to assess the feeding duration of detached I. ricinus nymphs, thereby indicating the level of human infection risk with B. burgdorferi s.l. I. ricinus nymphs were allowed to feed in capsules on tick-naive Mongolian gerbils for 0, 12, 24, 36 h, or to repletion, in groups of up to 9 individuals. After tick removal, the scutal index of each tick ( n=516) was determined using a stereomicroscope with an ocular micrometer. This was also possible, if the tick mouthparts were damaged. Although the scutal indices determined at 24 h versus 36 h post-attachment (a critical interval for B. burgdorferi transmission) differed significantly, there was some overlap between the 2 groups. However, by choosing a scutal index of 1.1 as a cut-off, it was possible to assign 93.2% of the ticks attached for <24 h ( n=310) to one group (low-risk group ticks) and 85.6% of those attached for 36 h ( n=97) to the other (high-risk group ticks). This means that those people from whom I. ricinus nymphs with a scutal index of >1.1 detached have a distinctly elevated risk of Borrelia infection and therefore more likely require medical attention.

AB  - Ticks are obligate blood feeding ectoparasites of vertebrates and induce huge production loss in livestock industry and creating serious public health problems in the world. This study was conducted to explore ethnoveterinary practices that are performed by livestock owners to control tick infestation in some districts of North Gondar, Ethiopia and to identify potential herbal materials used to control tick infestation in livestock. Three districts of the zone were selected from each agroecological zone. The data were collected using semi-structured questionnaire and field observation. Sixty randomly selected livestock owners were used as the source of information. Tick infestation is prevalent in all districts. Loss of body condition, disease transmission and damage of skin were the most commonly mentioned effects of tick infestation on the animals. The most commonly used tick control methods were use of acaricides and manual removal, however, use of herbs, washing with soap and cutting with sharp materials were also mentioned by respondents. Nine potential medicinal plants were identified that could be used to kill or repel ticks. In conclusion, tick infestation is the problem in the districts. Livestock owners use different techniques to remove tick from the animals and their effectiveness has to be evaluated. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.

AB  - The present study describes an accurate quantitative method for quantifying the adherence of conidia to the arthropod cuticle and the dynamics of conidial germination on the host. The method was developed using conidia of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and engorged Rhipicephalus annulatus (Say) (Arachnida: Ixodidae) females and was also verified for M. anisopliae var. acridum Driver et Milner (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae. This novel method is based on using an organic solvent (dichloromethane [DCM]) to remove the adhered conidia from the tick cuticle, suspending the conidia in a detergent solution, and then counting them using a hemocytometer. To confirm the efficacy of the method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the conidial adherence to and removal from the tick cuticle. As the concentration of conidia in the suspension increased, there were correlating increases in both the number of conidia adhering to engorged female R. annulatus and tick mortality. However, no correlation was observed between a tick's susceptibility to fungal infection and the amount of adhered conidia. These findings support the commonly accepted understanding of the nature of the adhesion process. The mechanism enabling the removal of the adhered conidia from the host cuticle is discussed.

As the concentration of conidia in the suspension increased, there were correlating increases in both the number of conidia adhering to engorged female R. annulatus and tick mortality. However, no correlation was observed between a tick's susceptibility to fungal infection and the amount of adhered conidia. These findings support the commonly accepted understanding of the nature of the adhesion process. The mechanism enabling the removal of the adhered conidia from the host cuticle is discussed.

AB  - The present study describes an accurate quantitative method for quantifying the adherence of conidia to the arthropod cuticle and the dynamics of conidial germination on the host. The method was developed using conidia of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and engorged Rhipicephalus annulatus (Say) (Arachnida: Ixodidae) females and was also verified for M. anisopliae var. acridum Driver et Milner (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) and Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae. This novel method is based on using an organic solvent (dichloromethane [DCM]) to remove the adhered conidia from the tick cuticle, suspending the conidia in a detergent solution, and then counting them using a hemocytometer. To confirm the efficacy of the method, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the conidial adherence to and removal from the tick cuticle. As the concentration of conidia in the suspension increased, there were correlating increases in both the number of conidia adhering to engorged female R. annulatus and tick mortality. However, no correlation was observed between a tick's susceptibility to fungal infection and the amount of adhered conidia.

AB  - The number of tick bites received by individuals wearing either permethrin-treated or untreated summer clothing (T-shirt, shorts, socks, and sneakers) was compared during a controlled indoor study. Pathogen-free nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say were placed on the left shoe, right leg, and left arm of 15 (5/treatment group/d) human volunteers wearing untreated outfits or outfits treated with permethrin either commercially or using a do-at-home treatment kit. The number and location of ticks attached to subjects' skin were recorded 2.5 h postinfestation. Subjects wearing outfits treated with permethrin received 3.36 times fewer tick bites than subjects wearing untreated outfits. No statistically significant differences in number of tick bites were detected between commercial permethrin treatment (19.33%) and the do-at-home permethrin application method (24.67%). The success of permethrin-treated clothing in reducing tick bites varied depending on the specific article of clothing. Subjects wearing permethrin-treated sneakers and socks were 73.6 times less likely to have a tick bite than subjects wearing untreated footware. Subjects wearing permethrin-treated shorts and T-shirts were 4.74 and 2.17 times, respectively, less likely to receive a tick bite in areas related to those specific garments than subjects wearing untreated shorts and T-shirts. Ticks attached to subjects were classified as alive or dead before removal. On subjects wearing untreated outfits, 97.6% of attached nymphs were alive, whereas significantly fewer (22.6%) attached nymphs were alive on subjects wearing repellent-treated outfits. Results of this study demonstrate the potential of permethrin-treated summer clothing for significantly reducing tick bites and tick-borne pathogen transmission.

AB  - Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by the tick-borne bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. Symptoms range from moderate illness to severe illness, including cardiovascular compromise, coma and death. The disease is prevalent in most of the USA, especially during warmer months. The trademark presentation is fever and rash with a history of tick bite, although tick exposure is unappreciated in over a third of cases. Other signature symptoms include headache and abdominal pain. The antibiotic therapy of choice for R. rickettsii infection is doxycycline. Preventive measures for Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other tick-borne diseases include: wearing long-sleeved, light colored clothing; checking for tick attachment and removing attached ticks promptly; applying topical insect repellent; and treating clothing with permethrin.

AB  - Introduction. Capybaras ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are considered amplifying hosts of Rickettsia sp. These rodents are usually parasitized by the tick vector, Amblyomma cajennense, the main vector of rickettsioses in humans and animals in South America. Capybaras can be used as sentinels in detection of circulation of rickettsiae. Objective. Antibodies to rickettsiae of spotted fever group were detected in capybaras in a rural area of Cordoba Province, northern Colombia. Materials and methods. Sera were analyzed from 36 capybaras in a rural area of Monteria (village of San Jeronimo) in Cordoba. For the detection of IgG antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence was performed. The antigens were derived from R. rickettsia strain Taiacu isolated in Brazil. Capybara sera were diluted 1:64 for IFA analysis. Ticks were collected from each capybara (also known as chiguiro) and identified to species. Results. The seroprevalence of spotted fever group Rickettsia was 22% (8 capybaras). Four sera had a titer of 1:64, 3 had a titer of 1:128 and one serum had a titer of 1:512. All ticks removed from the capybaras (n=933) were taxonomically identified as Amblyomma cajennense. Conclusion. Colombia has areas endemic for rickettsioses, as indicated by confirmed annual outbreaks. The current study reports the first evidence of natural rickettsial infection of the spotted fever group in capybaras from Colombia. The findings suggest that capybaras can be used as sentinels for the circulation of rickettsiae and can identify endemic areas for the transmission of rickettsial diseases.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis is one of the zoonotic and vectorial diseases in the world. Female of Taiga tick, Ixodes persulcatus play an important role being the main vector of the agents, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, of the disease in the Far East including Japan. The number of patients who contacted Lyme borreliosis have been estimated to be around 100 cases in all of Japan. We also detected the spirochetes from the skin tissues of 27 cases involving erythema and 3 cases without erythema after tick bites in Hokkaido. We noticed that in those cases when the victims removed ticks by themselves using their fingers within several days later, almost all of them developed erythema. On the other hand, an infected tick from 8 cases which were removed by surgical procedure, the spirochetes were not transmitted in these cases (No. 31-38). Therefore, we supposed that the transmission of agents takes place by regurgitation of the spirochestes from the midgut diverticula due to the pressure by fingers (calling Syringe phenomenon). Then, the authors recommended that fine tweezers has a firm grip around the mouth part of infested tick and pull out within 24 hours and/or trials to surgical operation for tick removal on passing over 24 hours after infestation.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite numerous research of Lyme disease (LD), there are still many concerns about environmental of infectious agent of LD, as well as its prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this work was to determine the risk of LD in relation to the way of removing ticks and duration of tick attachment.
METHODS: In the period from 2000 to 2007 a prospective study was conducted including persons with tick bite referred to the Institute of Epidemiology, Military Medical Academy, and followed for the occurrence of early Lyme disease up to six months after a tick bite. Epidemiological questionnaire was used to collect relevant information about the place and time of tick bites, the way of a removing tick, duration of tick attachment, remnants of a tick left in the skin (parts of the mouth device) and the signs of clinical manifestations of LD. Duration of tick attachment was determined on the basis of size of engorged tick and epidemiological data. Removed ticks were determined by the key of Pomerancev. Professional removing of attached tick was considered to be removing of tick with mechanical means by healthcare personnel. Fisher's exact test, Chi squares test and calculation of the relative risk (RR) were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Of 3 126 patients with tick bite, clinical manifestations of LD were demonstrated in 19 (0.61%). In the group of subjects (n = 829) in which a tick was not removed professionally there were 17 (2.05%) cases with LD, while in the group of respondents (n = 2 297) in who a tick was removed professionally there were 2 (0.09%) cases with LD after tick bite (RR, 23.55; p < 0.0001). The disease was most frequent in the group of respondents with incompletely and unprofessionally removed ticks (2.46%). In the groups of patients with unprofessionally but completely removed ticks LD occurred in 0.89%, while in the group of subjects with a tick removed by an expert, but incompletely in 0.78% cases. The disease occurred rarely in the group with a tick removed completely and professionally (0.05%). There was no case of LD in the group of patients with a tick removed within 24 hours. The longer time of exposure after 24 hours, the higher absolute risk of disease was reported.
CONCLUSION: In prevention of Lyme disease it is important to urgent remove a tick, to use a correct procedure of removing and to remove the whole tick without any remnants.

Fisher's exact test, Chi squares test and calculation of the relative risk (RR) were used for data analysis. Results. Of 3 126 patients with tick bite, clinical manifestations of LD were demonstrated in 19 (0.61%). In the group of subjects (n = 829) in which a tick was not removed professionally there were 17 (2.05%) cases with LD, while in the group of respondents (n = 2 297) in who a tick was removed professionally there were 2 (0.09%) cases with LD after tick bite (RR, 23.55; p < 0.0001). The disease was most frequent in the group of respondents with incompletely and unprofessionally removed ticks (2.46%). In the groups of patients with unprofessionally but completely removed ticks LD occurred in 0.89%, while in the group of subjects with a tick removed by an expert, but incompletely in 0.78% cases. The disease occurred rarely in the group with a tick removed completely and professionally (0.05%). There was no case of LD in the group of patients with a tick removed within 24 hours. The longer time of exposure after 24 hours, the higher absolute risk of disease was reported. Conclusion. In prevention of Lyme disease it is important to urgent remove a tick, to use a correct procedure of removing and to remove the whole tick without any remnants.

AB  - A detailed account of the piroplasmoses of cattle in the Vardar Banat, a region in the south-east of Yugoslavia, with a review of the literature on piroplasms of the neighbouring countries. Four separate infections have been diagnosed, Babesia bigemina, B. major n.sp., Theileria mutans and Th. dispar. B. major occurs in the peripheral blood as a single or double round body or may rarely be quadruple. The commonest forms, however, are single or double pear-shaped bodies. Boophilus anulatus is held to be the vector of B. bigemina infection, and Ixodes ricinus, Hyalomma aegyptium and Rhipicephalus bursa the vectors of B. major infection. Clinically, these infections have to be differentiated from anthrax and haemor-rhagic septicaemia. For treatment, trypaflavine has been found efficacious against B. bigemina infection, whilst " ichthargan " is preferred against B. major infection. The theileriases cannot be cured with drugs and it is necessary to control them by the eradication of ticks, by removal of sources of infection, and by vaccination according to the method used in Algeria. It is also necessary to acclimatize all imported animals and desirable to place susceptible cattle on alpine pastures during the dangerous season.-J. E.

AB  - Inquiries regarding tick exposure can be important in dermatologic diagnosis and treatment since ticks can be vectors of a diversity of infectious diseases. The classic teaching is that ticks are best removed with nail polish, solvents, petrolatum, mineral oil, or a hot match. However, a recent evaluation of tick removal revealed that mechanical removal with forceps preceded and followed by disinfection is the most effective method. In most cases, should the characteristic dermatologic lesion or systemic symptoms appear, appropriate treatment should be initiated for presumptive diseases.

AB  - Lyme disease is endemic in Europe. The strains of the causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, seem to be antigenically more heterogeneous than the North American isolates. The only documented vector for this bacterium in Europe is ixodes ricinus, but other vectors might be involved as observed in the United States. The tick hosts are not yet well documented in Europe. Human infection occurs principally during summer months. The clinical aspect of the disease has particular features in Europe: at the early stage of the disease, a single and large erythema chronicum migrans is observed on the skin; complications often include meningoradiculonevritis (Bannwarth's syndrome) and later, acrodermatitis chronica atrophians; arthritis is less frequent in Europe than in the USA. The culture of B. burgdorferi from the lesions is difficult. The diagnosis of the disease is performed on the basis of serological tests: immunofluorescence assay where the important thing is to define a cutoff titer; ELISA tests using either whole cells or supernatant of sonicated cells or flagellar antigen; passive haemagglutination for IgG; IgM solid phase haemadsorption; Western blot (immunoblot) seems interesting to perform on a research basis to determine to which protein antigens patients are responding with antibody. Once antibody production begins, it is usually in the form of IgM antibody to flagellin protein (41 kD), with time, both IgM and IgG antibodies to a variety of other antigens appear. Prophylaxis is based on health services and public education because a prompt removal of the tick diminishes risk of infection with B. burgdorferi (4 p. cent of cases after tick bite). The treatment includes aminopenicillins or tetracyclines at the early stage. The second and third stages of borreliosis are treated by high doses aminopenicillins or cetriaxone. [References: 76]

AB  - The objective of this research was to determine the most appropriate protective behaviours to promote in order to protect members of the public from Lyme borreliosis, to identify the drivers and barriers for these behaviours, and to determine the strongest predictors of tick-protective behaviour. We used a mixed methods study with qualitative interviews and a quantitative web survey. Interviews with topic experts and members of the public suggested that predictors of tick checking included perceived disease likelihood and severity as well as overall awareness of ticks and tick-borne disease. Twenty-four percent of participants regularly checked for ticks after walking in a tick-endemic area. The strongest predictors of checking for ticks were greater levels of knowledge, perceived likelihood of being bitten, self-efficacy about tick removal, and lower levels of disgust about ticks. Barriers to checking included forgetfulness and lacking time. At-risk members of the UK public require information to increase awareness of ticks and protective behaviours, particularly tick checking. Information may be most effective if it focuses on increasing self-efficacy while also reducing disgust. (copyright) 2014.

AB  - A survey to document tick control methods used by resource-limited farmers in the control of cattle ticks in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa was conducted by interviewing 59 cattle farmers using structured questionnaires and general conversation. Information collected was on external parasites of cattle, their effects and their control methods. Ticks were reported to be a major problem causing diseases like anaplasmosis (89.8%), babesiosis (55.9%) and ehrlichiosis (16.9%), as well as wounds that predispose to screwworm infestation, tick worry and teat damage to cows troubling farmers in their farming enterprises. The main tick control methods were; acaricides provided by government, however 94.9% of the farmers interviewed were of the opinion that the dip wash is not effective in killing the ticks. As a result, farmers complement the government dipping service with their own initiatives like spraying with conventional acaricides (22%), household disinfectants such as Jeyes fluid (18.6%), used engine oil (10.2%), chickens (5.1%), manual removal (5.1%), and pouricides (1.7%). In addition, some farmers also use plants (6.8%), mainly the leaf of Aloe ferox and the bark of Ptaeroxylon obliquum. The study revealed ticks to be a major problem in the study area.

AB  - Background: It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatment after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite will prevent Lyme disease. Methods: In an area of New York where Lyme disease is hyperendemic, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in 482 subjects who had removed attached I. scapularis ticks from their bodies within the previous 72 hours. At base line, three weeks, and six weeks, subjects were interviewed and examined, and serum antibody tests were performed, along with blood cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi. Results: Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite in a significantly smaller proportion of the subjects in the doxycycline group than of those in the placebo group (1 of 235 subjects [0.4 percent] vs. 8 of 247 subjects [3.2 percent], P<0.04). The efficacy of treatment was 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 25 to 98 percent). Objective extracutaneous signs of Lyme disease did not develop in any subject, and there were no asymptomatic seroconversions. Treatment with doxycycline was associated with more frequent adverse effects (in 30.1 percent of subjects, as compared with 11.1 percent of those assigned to placebo; P<0.001), primarily nausea (15.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Erythema migrans developed more frequently after untreated bites from nymphal ticks than after bites from adult female ticks (8 of 142 bites [5.6 percent] vs. 0 of 97 bites [0 percent], P=0.02). Conclusions: A single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours after an I. scapularis tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme disease. Copyright © 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB  - Five methods commonly advocated for tick removal from a human or domestic animal were evaluated. The application of petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, 70% isopropyl alcohol, or a hot kitchen match failed to induce detachment of adult American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say) attached for either 12 to 15 hours or three to four days. Use of forceps or protected fingers enabled satisfactory removal of 29 adult American dog ticks without leaving the mouthparts or attachment cement in the host skin. Four different methods were used to pull lone star ticks [Amblyomma americanum (L)] off the host using forceps (twisting, pulling steadily or jerking straight up, or pulling parallel with the skin). None of the mouthparts broke off, but, contrary to the American dog tick, the cement remained in the skin for all 22 of the Lone Star ticks. It is recommended that the tick be grasped as close to the skin as possible with curved forceps; if these are not available, use tweezers or protected fingers. Pull straight up with steady even pressure. If cement or mouthparts remain, then extract if that is practical. Disinfect bite site before and after tick removal.

AB  - The view that the causal agent of sweating sickness is a toxin produced by adults of Hyalomma truncatum Koch ( transiens Schulze) in the process of feeding [ cf. preceding abstract] and not a virus, as previously supposed, was suggested by repeated failure to transmit it from calf to calf by various methods of inoculation and supported by the experiments at Onderstepoort described in this paper, which show that it does not multiply in the vertebrate host and that the severity of the reactions produced by it depend on the duration of feeding of the ticks. It has been found possible to breed large numbers of ticks that can be relied on to transmit the disease without fail to susceptible animals, and batches of such ticks were allowed to feed on the ears of calves or white pigs to infect them or test whether they had acquired immunity. White pigs are particularly suitable test animals as it is easy to detect the characteristic hyperaemia of the skin as an early symptom, and the development of pharyngeal and laryngeal lesions can be judged by changes in the tone and pitch of their squeals. Calves on which 16, 12 and 7 ticks fed for one, two and three days showed no reaction and were susceptible on challenge. Feeding for three days by 12 or more ticks caused no reaction- but resulted in the development of immunity in a calf and in three out of four pigs. Feeding periods of five days or more and generally those of four days were followed by reactions that were usually severe and often ended fatally, even if the number of ticks feeding was small. The experiments on the two kinds of animals were in agreement in that the severity of the reactions depended on the duration of feeding by the ticks rather than on the number that attached and that infection was passed to the host from the tick during the early stage of engorgement, long before repletion was reached. As the timely removal of the ticks is followed by subsidence of symptoms with recovery and development of immunity, it is concluded that the effects of infection could be eliminated by the use of a system of tick control in which H. truncatum was allowed to feed for not less than two and not more than four days. This could be achieved by dipping or spraying every five days or treatment every, seven days with an acaricide having a lasting effect of not less than two days.

TY  - BOOK
AB  - This book is a treatise on the parasitic diseases, internal or external, of dogs and cats, the parasite in each case being described and figured. The following is a brief summary of that part of the book which is of ientomological interest. The dog flea is noticed as the carrier of Dipylidium caninum, the common tape-worm of the dog. A good method of ridding dogs of fleas is to dip them, hind legs first, in a bath of 2 1/2-3 per cent potassium sulfide in warm water. The immersion should be conducted slowly so that the liquid may thoroughly penetrate the hair. A 2 per cent. solution of creoline is almost equally effective and both are greatly superior to 1 per cent. carbolic acid, which should never be used for cats. A good plan for ridding a cat of fleas is to cut a square of cotton wool large enough to envelop the animal, place this on a piece of calico with the cat in the centre, then spray the fur rapidly with camphorated alcohol and wrap the animal's body in the cotton wool, tying the corners of the square of calico round its neck. Many of the fleas seek refuge in the head and may be combed out, but large numbers will be found entangled in the cotton wool, which may be burned. Chiggers, Dermatophilus penetrans[Tunga penetrans], attack sheep, goats, dogs, and especially pigs. A related species, Echidnophaga larina, occurring at the Cape, in Abyssinia and in Somaliland, attacks wild mammals and also dogs. Chiggers usually infest the feet of dogs, but frequently also the ears. Affections of the skin are caused by various lice, Haematopinus pilifer, Trichodectes latus and T. subrostratus. Haematopinus especially frequents longhaired sporting dogs; Trichodectes, smaller house dogs and toy dogs with long hair. Trichodectes latus is possibly the intermediate host of a Taenia. Among dipterous parasites, the larvae of Wohlfartia ( Sarcophaga) magnifica, Schiner, are frequently found in the ears of dogs, according to Portchinsky. Cordylobia anthropophaga attacks dogs in Africa and cases are quoted in which five or six larvae per diem were taken from one dog for several weeks together. A larva of Cuterebra emasculator, Fitch, has been taken from a dog at Montreal and another case is reported in a cat. The larva of Dermatobia cyani-ventris is said by Coquerel and Salle to be very common in dogs in Brazil. The eggs are laid on leaves in damp places frequented by Janthinosoma lutzi, Theo., and becoming attached to the mosquito, the larvae are thus carried to the animal host [see this Review, Ser. B, i, p. 106]. Ornithodoros moubata, Murray, is the only Argasid which attacks dogs, but the numerous Ixodid ticks which have been found to infest them include: - Ixodes ricinus, L., I. heocagonus, Leach, 7. pilosiis in N. Africa; I. pilosus howardi, Nm., in Natal and the Transvaal; I. ovatus, Nm., in Japan; I. holocydus, Nm., in Queensland; I. scapularis, Say, in Florida and Texas; I. rasus, Nm., in the Congo; Haerna-physalis flava, Nrn., in Japan and China; H. concinna kochi, Nm., and H. neumanni, Donitz, in Japan; H. kachi, Aud., in Africa; Dermacentor reticidatus, F., and D. variabilis, Say, in North America. Rhipi-cephalus sanguineus specially affects the dog and is the intermediate host of Haemogregarina canis. The following ticks have also been found on dogs in various parts of the world: Rhipicephalus bursa, Can., R. simus, Koch; R. punctatissimus, Gerst., 72. capensis, Koch, 72. evertsi, Nm., R. appendiculatus, Nm., R. pulchellus, Gerst., 72. tricuspis, Don., R. texanus, Banks, Margaropus annulatus, Say, Hyalomma aegyptium, L., Amblyomma cajennense, F., A. calcaratum, Nm., A striatum, Koch, A. fossum, Nm., A. americanum, L., A. maculatum, Koch, A. hebraeum, Koch, Aponomma exornatum, Koch, A. inprnatum, Banks. Ticks are best removed from dogs by touching with a drop of benzol, petrol or turpentine. Cats are rarely attacked by ticks. Among the Acarids panging disease in dogs and cats, Tydeus molestus, Moniez, has been found in Belgium and is believed to have entered the country in guano from Peru imported to an isolated farm on the grass land of which it increased with extraordinary speed and attacked all the live stock as well as man. Trombidium holosericeum and other species cause great annoyance to sporting dogs and sometimes to cats. Zurn and Megnin report cases of dogs and cats attacked by Dermanyssus gallinae, Redi. Sarcoptes scabiei, Lat., attacks the dog and the cat; a large species, probably that of the pig, S. scabiei suis ( S. squamifer, Furst.) has been found on a dog by Cadiot and Eaillet. The pathological conditions produced by Demodex folliculorum canis ( D. caninus, Tulk.) are fully discussed. Sarcoptes cati, Herring, generally attacks old individuals among cats, but the author thinks this is merely the result of greater exposure to infection. S. cati may be transferred to the horse by cats sleeping in the stable and is communicable to man. Treatment is difficult in the cat, but a one per cent. solution of zinc chloride is said to be very effective. Demodex folliculorum cati, which resembles that of the dog, but is smaller, has been found in the external meatus of the ear. Grassi's filaria, Filaria ( Acanthocheilonema) grassii, Noe, is conveyed to dogs by Rhipicephalus sanguineus. More than fifty species of trypano-somes have been described as attacking mammals, of which about one-half are not pathogenic. Dogs may be inoculated with any form, but are normally attacked by seven varieties which, if not promptly treated, generally cause death, viz., T. evansi, T. annamense, T. togolense, T. brucei, T. dimorphon, T. congolense and T. pecaudi. Surra has attacked sporting dogs imported from England into Bombay, Burma and the Punjab, and during the epidemic of surra in Mauritius (1902-04) several dogs died of the disease. Leishmaniasis is common in dogs in North Africa and is transmissible to man by the dog flea, Ctenocephalus canis[Ctenocephalides canis]. Visentini reported that the destruction of starving dogs in the Lipari Islands acted as a prophylactic against the spread of the disease to man. Piroplasmosis (babesiasis) in dogs is known in all tropical countries and in some others, and imported dogs are peculiarly liable to be attacked. The disease is conveyed in France by Dermacentor reticulatus[Dermacentor pictus] and possibly by Ixodes ricinus; in South Africa by Haemaphysalisleachi; in India by Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Another form, Piroplasma gibsoni, Patt., of which the jackal is probably the reservoir, is carried by a tick closely related to R. simus. Haemo-gregarina canis, which does not seriously affect the dog's health, is said by Christophers to be carried by R. sanguineus. Dirofilaria immitis, Leid., is very widespread, especially in China and the East. No breed of dog is immune and the larger dogs are specially attacked; the disease is rare in small house dogs, at least in Europe. Grassi and Noe have shown that Anopheles maculipennis, Meig., is the intermediate host of D. immitis, in which it develops in the Malpighian tubules. Dirofilaria repens, Bailliet and Henry, lives in the subcutaneous connective tissues of the dog, and the embryos in the blood. The animals do not appear to be seriously affected as a rule, but Guby and Delafond have observed epileptiform attacks in dogs infested with this parasite. Stegomyia fasciata, F., is the intermediate host, and the development of the embryo is identical with that of D. immitis in A. maculipennis; it is possible that the latter insect also serves as an intermediate host. The principal parasites which attack the ears of dogs and cats are the mites, Chorioptes cynotis canis and G.cynotisfelis, which produce acute tympanitis. Ferrets are liable to the attacks of Sarcoptes scabiei furonis, Raill., which differs in some characters from S. scabiei of the dog, and is slightly larger. In 1884, a serious epidemic of parasitic otitis in ferrets occurred all over the north of France, especially near Calais, due to Chorioptes cynotis furonis, Megnin. The animals did not appear to suffer such pain as dogs and cats attacked by parasitic otitis, but the death rate was very heavy.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis is the most common tickborne infection in Norway. All clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis other than erythema migrans are notifiable to Folkehelseinstituttet, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. During the period 1995-2004 a total of 1506 cases of disseminated and chronic Lyme borreliosis were reported. Serological tests were the basis for laboratory diagnosis in almost all cases. The annual numbers of cases showed no clear trend over the period, but varied each year between 120 and 253 cases, with the highest number of cases reported in 2004. Seventy five per cent of cases with information on time of onset were in patients who fell ill during the months of June to October. There was marked geographical variation in reported incidence rates, with the highest rates reported from coastal counties in southern and central Norway. Fifty six per cent of the cases were in males and 44% in females. The highest incidence rate was found in children aged between 5 and 9 years. Neuroborreliosis was the most common clinical manifestation (71%), followed by arthritis/arthralgia (22%) and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (5%). Forty six per cent of patients were admitted to hospital. Prevention of borreliosis in Norway relies on measures to prevent tick bites, such as use of protective clothing and insect repellents, and early detection and removal of ticks. Antibiotics are generally not recommended for prophylaxis after tick bites in Norway.

AB  - Background: The incidence of tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe. Sub national information on tick distribution, ecology and vector status is often lacking. However, precise location of infection risk can lead to better targeted prevention measures, surveillance and control. Methods: In this context, the current paper compiled geolocated tick occurrences in Belgium, a country where tick-borne disease has received little attention, in order to highlight the potential value of spatial approaches and draw some recommendations for future research priorities. Results: Mapping of 89,289 ticks over 654 sites revealed that ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes hexagonus are largely present while Dermacentor reticulatus has a patchy distribution. Suspected hot spots of tick diversity might favor pathogen exchanges and suspected hot spots of I. ricinus abundance might increase human-vector contact locally. This underlines the necessity to map pathogens and ticks in detail. While I. ricinus is the main vector, I. hexagonus is a vector and reservoir of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., which is active the whole year and is also found in urban settings. This and other nidiculous species bite humans less frequently, but seem to harbour pathogens. Their role in maintaining a pathogenic cycle within the wildlife merits investigation as they might facilitate transmission to humans if co-occurring with I. ricinus. Many micro-organisms are found abroad in tick species present in Belgium. Most have not been recorded locally but have not been searched for. Some are transmitted directly at the time of the bite, suggesting promotion of tick avoidance additionally to tick removal. Conclusion: This countrywide approach to tick-borne diseases has helped delineate recommendations for future research priorities necessary to design public health policies aimed at spatially integrating the major components of the ecological cycle of tick-borne diseases. A systematic survey of tick species and associated pathogens is called for in Europe, as well as better characterisation of species interaction in the ecology of tick-borne diseases, those being all tick species, pathogens, hosts and other species which might play a role in tick-borne diseases complex ecosystems.

AB  - The match between ticks and pediatricians in Italy is usually a seasonal event related to the spring and summer trips and to the increasing of outdoor activity that sun and warm weather allow, both for children and ticks. So cared parents reach emergencies asking for tick removal but more often after the tick has yet been removed by empirical manoeuvres and after the killing and the destruction of the "enemy". We have scheduled, in the years 2002-2003, the 167 children that reached our unit for a tick bite; they where 92 males (mean age four years) and 75 females (mean age five years). Two of them had only a questionable tick bite but one had erythema on the lateral side of the left ankle, fever of obscure origin and weakness with generalised malaise. She was six years old and she lived with a dog on which, in more instances, ticks where found, but she never noticed ticks on her body. The dog had positive levels of anti rickettsial and anti borrelia antibodies but no evidence of conclamate illness. In this girl we found high titers of anti borrelia antibodies that WB testing confirmed to be anti B. burgdoferi. We diagnosed Lyme disease and treated the girl with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day) for three weeks achieving the complete relief of symptomatology till today. Three children with conclamate tick bite had positive levels of anti Rickettsia conorii antibodies with increasing levels at a twenty days control; two (aged four and five years) of them had a full symptomatology (tache noire, satellite lymphadenopathy, fever, and maculopapular erythema) for Meditarranean spotted fever; the latter (three years old) had an atypical form with the complete absence of maculopapular erythema. The therapy was clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/day) for three weeks. In Campania, in the years 2002/2003 on 167 children with tick bite that reached our unit, we found only four pathological correlable events; so are our ticks not infected? But we don't know how many children where tick bited and if there were other children with Lyme disease or Rickettsial disease because of the lack of a pediatric reference centre for "tick bite diseases" and the incomplete and late diffusion of knowledge on these diseases. Other Italian regions and such as Trentino Alto Adige, Veneto, and Friuli Venezia Giulia had a remarkable officially notified number of cases of Lyme disease and in Sicilia, Sardegna and Lazio there were numerous officially notified Rickettsial diseases. So we hope that Campania may be an happy island but we also think that a more effective cooperation between pediatricians and veterinarians and the creation of regional reference centres for tick bite diseases may arise a surveillance net to prevent the diffusion of these world wide emerging diseases and so that parents can achieve an univoque and useful information, the only way to defeat the fear of ignorance.

AB  - Introduction: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease with a high mortality rate. In clinical practice, we observed bradycardia in some pediatric patients with CCHF during the clinical course. So we aimed to report CCHF cases that presented bradycardia during the clinical course and the relation of bradycardia with the clinical findings and ribavirin therapy. Methods: Charts of all hospitalized pediatric CCHF patients were reviewed with respect to age, sex, history of tick bite or history of removing a tick, other risk factors for CCHF transmission, and interval between the tick bite and the onset of symptoms. Outcomes and clinical and laboratory findings and medications were recorded for each patient. We searched the patient records for information regarding the existence of bradycardia. Bradycardia was accepted as the heart rate 2 standard deviations (SD) lower than the suspected heart rate based on age. Results: Fifty-two patients (mean age 11.24.4 years, 31 female) were enrolled into the study. Bradycardia was seen in seven patients. Six patients with bradycardia were male and only one was female, and the mean age was 13.11.6 years. It was observed that male gender is frequent among patients with bradycardia, as compared with those without bradycardia ( p=0.01). Bleeding was found to be more frequent in patients with bradycardia ( p=0.02). There were significant differences between the bradycardia and nonbradycardia groups with regard to the requirements for fresh frozen plasma transfusion, the number of platelet suspension given, requirement for intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and in the days of stay in hospital ( p=0.01, p=0.03, p=0.03, p=0.04, respectively). Conclusion: Reversible bradycardia might be seen in the clinical course of pediatric CCHF patients, and the clinicians must be aware of this finding. The possibility that ribavirin may potentiate bradycardia cannot be assessed without a placebo-control study. So further studies may help to reveal the cause of the bradycardia, the disease itself, or the ribavirin therapy. Hence this study supports the need for a randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess intravenous ribavirin in treating CCHF and to support approval of the drug.

AB  - Tick bites, associated clinical symptoms, and antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were investigated in 77 Finnish army recruits training during summer in an endemic region and 50 control recruits serving outside the habitat of ticks. During a follow-up of 6 months, 26.9% of the study recruits reported tick bites. None gave a history of erythema migrans. Five study recruits and none in the control group had a combination of two or three nonspecific symptoms compatible with Lyme borreliosis. Three of these five study recruits had been bitten by several ticks. Thirteen (16.9%) study recruits and two (4.0%) control recruits had positive antibody levels against B. burgdorferi in their first serum specimens. No significant change in immunoglobulin G antibody levels was seen between the first and second specimens. Immunoglobulin M antibody levels increased in the sera of 13 (11.9%) study recruits and 1 (3.0%) control recruit. We conclude that recruits training in tick habitats are at high risk of tick bites. All recruits starting their military training in endemic areas should be taught to recognize and remove ticks and advised to wear protective clothing.

AB  - Groups of 5 Boscat white rabbits (1.25-1.5 kg) were vaccinated with H. dromedarii tick eggs antigen (Antigen I; 1 mg/kg s.c.), sex organs with midgut antigen (Antigen II; 1.2 mg/kg s.c.), or kept as non-vaccinated controls. The rabbits were inoculated twice with an interval of 2 weeks. Immune response was measured by ELISA and the rabbits were challenged with 10 adult unfed, female ticks 14 days after the second inoculation. Immunized rabbits, developed variable serum antibody titres. Ticks removed from immunized rabbits 2 weeks after challenge showed significant reductions in tick weight, egg mass weight, oviposition period and percentage of egg hatchability. Three specific immunogenic bands were detected for antigen I and 4 for antigen II by PAGE. Sex organs with midgut antigen induced better protection than the egg antigen.

AB  - Rickettsia slovaca is considered the aetiological agent of tickborne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), an emerging disease transmitted by tick bites. Dermacentor marginatus constitutes the most important vector and wild boar ( S. scrofa) is the main wild host in our area. The epidemiology of this tickborne rickettsioses has not been completely clarified. During the 2004 hunting season, 27 wild boar sera sample were collected from northeastern Spain. Ticks were collected both from wild boar and from flagging vegetation in the same areas where wild boar were hunted. A serological study was carried out using the immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) technique. Ticks were identified as D. marginatus and Rhipicephalus turanicus. Based on sequence analysis on ompA gene, Rickettsia slovaca was identified in 30.5% D. marginatus ticks removed from wild boar and in 33.3% D. marginatus collected from flagging vegetation. Rickettsia sp. RpA4 was identified in 4 specimens of D. marginatus removed from wild boar. Twelve of 23 wild boar were seropositive to R. slovaca. Results suggest that wild boar are exposed to Rickettsia slovaca infection and this pathogen is well established in the life cycle of D. marginatus in our area.

AB  - The authors report some preliminary data on the epidemiological characteristics of Lyme disease in La Rioja, northern Spain, based on serological studies conducted from March 1988 to November 1989. 29 (5.8%) of 500 human serum samples were positive for anti- Borrelia burgdorferi antibody by the indirect fluorescence antibody test. No relation was found between sex, age or rural residence and seropositivity, although a significantly higher seroprevalence (30.3%) was found in people residing in forest areas, where Ixodes ricinus and deer were present, than in the rest of the population. Foresters and ranchers were at increased risk of contracting Lyme disease, and contact with domestic animals was also a risk factor for seropositivity. The authors refer to the work of B.S. Schwartz & M.D. Goldstein (1990) [see American Journal of Epidemiology, 131: 877-], and the senior author of that work comments on their findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are two questions regarding tick transmitted diseases (Ixodidae) not sufficiently elucidated: How to remove the arthropod? and: should antibiotic prophylaxis be administered after the bite?
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From June 1st, 1991, to December, 31, 1992, all patients who were attended at La Rioja Hospital relating immediate bite or tick bite within the 48 hours before were prospectively studied. In all those patients an epidemiological inquiry was obtained, which included, apart from personal data and risk factors for tick bites, how arthropods had been removed, health exam and blood drawn for serological study for Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia conorii. The protocol was repeated at one, two, four and six months after the bite. The removal method used at the Hospital was by pulling with fine tweezers and later disinfection with iodine povidone.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 52 individuals who complied with the established criteria, only 41 ended the follow-up. A 63.4 percent of patients experienced some type of complication, including 3 cases of LB (erythema migrans). With regard to the type of removal method and the development of complications, only three patients who had ticks pulled with tweezers experienced complications compared with 23 patients who used other methods (p = 0.0058). With regard to specific complications (LB and/or spotted fever) and/or development of B. burgdorferi or R. conorii infection significant differences were also observed when tweezers were used for removal of ticks compared with other tick removal methods (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The removal of ticks with tweezers significantly protects from the development of complications and infection by tick-borne microorganisms. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended when the removal of the arthropod is carried out by using a method other than the recommended one.

AB  - From 1 June 1991 to 31 December 1992, all patients who attended La Rioja Hospital, Spain, for tick bite within 48 h of being bitten were prospectively studied. All patients were surveyed for risk factors for tick bites and method of tick removal, they were given an examination, and blood was drawn for serological study for Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia conorii. The protocol was repeated at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after the bite. The removal method used at the hospital was pulling with fine tweezers and later disinfection with iodine povidone. Of a total of 52 individuals who complied with the established criteria, only 41 ended the follow-up. 63.4% of patients experienced some type of complication, and there were 3 cases of Lyme borreliosis (LB; erythema migrans).

AB  - Our objective was to learn the prevalence of spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia detected in ticks in La Rioja, in the north of Spain. From 2001 to 2005, 496 ticks representing 7 tick species were analysed at the Hospital de La Rioja. Ticks were removed from humans with or without rickettsial syndrome ( n=59) or collected from mammals ( n=371) or from vegetation by dragging ( n=66). The presence of SFG Rickettsia in these ticks was investigated by semi-nested PCR ( ompA gene) and sequencing. A phylogenetic tree using Clustal method (neighbor-joining) was constructed with these data. Only 3 of 170 Hyalomma marginatum ticks carried SFG Rickettsia. Sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of Rickettsia aeschlimannii (1.8%). Furthermore, Rickettsia massiliae and BAR29 were found in 3 of 120 Rhipicephalus sanguineus specimens (2.5%). In contrast, 81 of 83 tested Dermacentor marginatus ticks were PCR-positive (97%). Rickettsia slovaca (40.6%) and Rickettsia sp. strains RpA4, DnS14, DnS28 and JL-02 (59.3%) were found within this tick species. No SFG Rickettsia was detected using ompA primers when Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus eversti eversti, Hyalomma detritum scupense and Rhipicephalus sp. were analyzed. We detected 17.5% of ticks associated with different SFG Rickettsia: R. aeschlimannii, R. massiliae, BAR29, R. slovaca and Rickettsia sp. strains RpA4, DnS14, DnS28 and JL-02. Their presence has to be taken into account since most of them have been recognized as human pathogens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determination of the properties of ticks, which are the vectors of many infectious diseases and the patients with tick bites are important for the prevention of these diseases. For tist reason, the purpose of this study is to determine the important properties of the cases presenting with tick bites to Dokuz Eylul University Hospital and of the removed ticks from the cases.
METHODS: Two hundred seventy three of 294 patients, who presented with tick bites to Dokuz Eylul University Hospital, Izmir, were included in the study. Demographic parameters, symptoms related to tick borne diseases of the patients and the species and other characteristics of ticks removed from humans, also the tick population in the related habitat were investigated.
RESULTS: Removed ticks were classified into five genera. The overwhelmingly dominant genera were Hyalomma and it comprised 52.4% of the collection. The majority of these ticks were nymphs. The majority (11.4%) of removed adult ticks were Rhipicephalus sanguineus (R. sanguineus). In most cases (60.7%) the ticks were removed from the patients by medical staff.
CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in removing ticks without damage between the health personnel and the patient or relatives (p=0.133).

AB  - Prescribed fire was investigated as a method for controlling ixodid and argasid ticks in chaparral habitats in northern California. Two experimental and two adjacent control plots within a wildlife preserve were monitored for 1 yr postburn. Ticks were collected by flagging vegetation, by CO 2-baited pitfall trap, and by live-trapping rodents. Twice as many rodents were caught at control sites compared with burn sites and no dusky-footed woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes Baird, were found in the treatment sites postburn. This species is known to be a reservoir of the agents of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum Dumler, Barbet, Bekker, Dasch, Palmer, Ray, Rikihisa, Rurangirwa. Six ixodid tick species were removed from rodents ( Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls, Ixodes jellisoni Cooley & Kohls, Ixodes spinipalpis Hadwen & Nuttall, Ixodes woodi Bishopp, Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, and Dermacentor parumapertus Neumann), two of which transmit bacterial zoonotic agents to people in the far-western United States. There was no decrease in number of ticks per animal trapped at either burn site compared with controls; in fact, the mean number of immature I. pacificus per rodent was significantly higher at one burn site than its control site. Soil refugia may protect ticks from fire-induced mortality; the argasid tick Ornithodoros coriaceus Koch, which lives in soil, was unaffected by the prescribed fire as were I. pacificus and D. occidentalis buried in packets 2.5 cm below ground. We conclude that although prescribed fires in chaparral habitats may diminish local rodent abundance, it does not decrease tick loads on rodents. Furthermore, burning chaparral does not result in a decreased abundance of adult ixodid ticks on vegetation and apparently does not affect argasid or ixodid ticks that are sheltered within soil refugia.

AB  - Although bovine piroplasmosis has been previously known in France [ R.A.E., B, viii, 19], it is only recently that cases of piroplasmosis in. horses have been recorded, from Loire-Inferieure and from Haute-Marne. It is thought that this disease is frequently confused with anaemia in horses, as it is not very easy to diagnose. The removal of ticks from the animals by hand or by brushing is a sure method of prevention, and in cases of severe infestation the remedies previously suggested [ loc. cit.] are recommended.

AB  - In summer 2008, two fatal cases were observed in Northeastern Greece: a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case (first report in Greece) and a Mediterranean spotted fever case. In total, 537 ticks removed from humans who referred for this reason to the two hospitals of the region during June-September 2008 were identified. The vast majority of them (81.5%) were Rhipicephalus sanguineus, which is the main vector of Rickettsia conorii, while Hyalomma marginatum, the main vector of CCHF virus, accounted for 5.2%. The increased aggressiveness of R. sanguineus might be related to the weather conditions occurred during 2007-2008, while a variety of factors, including climate, might play a role in CCHF emergence.

AB  - Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by infected ticks. The transmission depends on several factors, especially on the duration of the tick's presence in the host body (the nymph which is smaller than the adults and thus less visible, is in this case the most frequently involved) and on whether the tick is infected or not. The interpretation of results in the few available studies is made difficult by the lack of information obtained (due to difficulty to collect information and examination costs). The comparison is made even more difficult by the difference between Borrelia ticks species in various regions. Today, the best methods are preventive: protective clothing, tick repellents, checking and removal of ticks after a journey in an endemic zone, and in case of tick bite, regular examination of the bite site during the following weeks in order to initiate an early curative treatment if ECM is diagnosed. The currently available data seems to be insufficient to suggest systematic antimicrobial prophylaxis in case of tick bite. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The transmission depends on several factors, especially on the duration of the tick's presence in the host body (the nymph which is smaller than the adults and thus less visible, is in this case the most frequently involved) and on whether the tick is infected or not. The interpretation of results in the few available studies is made difficult by the lack of information obtained (due to difficulty to collect information and examination costs). The comparison is made even more difficult by the difference between Borrelia ticks species in various regions. Today, the best methods are preventive: protective clothing, tick repellents, checking and removal of ticks after a journey in an endemic zone, and in case of tick bite, regular examination of the bite site during the following weeks in order to initiate an early curative treatment if ECM is diagnosed. The currently available data seems to be insufficient to suggest systematic antimicrobial prophylaxis in case of tick bite. [References: 108]

AB  - Lyme borreliosis is the most frequent vector-borne disease in North America and Europe. Currently the most important way to face it is prevention with the diffusion of correct information. The principal goals of prevention are to avoid tick bites and to stop the progression of the disease. These results are obtained by a correct behavior and, in case of a tick bite, by proper procedures that can reduce the risk of infection. Patients need to be instructed about the correct tick removal method and about the possible signs and symptoms of the disease. The use of prophylactic antimicrobials following a tick bite is not recommended. Due to the problems of scarce sensitivity, specificity and standardization, serological tests should not be used as screening method.

AB  - Tick paralysis is a rare, but readily treatable condition that if missed can lead to significant morbidity and death. The classic clinical presentation of tick paralysis is the development of an unsteady, ataxic type gait followed by an acute symmetric ascending flaccid paralysis. Symptoms generally begin within 2 to 6 days of tick attachment. If the tick continues to feed, the weakness ascends to the upper extremities over a matter of hours, followed by cranial nerve involvement. Due to the similarity in its presentation, tick paralysis is often misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre's syndrome, particularly the Miller Fisher's subtype, given its cranial nerve involvement. However, the weakness seen in tick paralysis progresses more quickly than what is generally seen in Guillain-Barre's syndrome and the protein concentration is not elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid. The mainstay of treatment for tick paralysis is tick removal. The time to full neurologic recovery after tick removal is estimated to be around 1.5 days with initial improvement generally within hours.

AB  - The article consists of a few short notes on six diseases and injuries met with in camels in Somaliland, together with tables giving the results of the estimation of the haemoglobin content of the blood of ten camels. A solution of a proprietary agent, " White Fluid " (an emulsion of tar acids and neutral hydrocarbons) is recommended for the treatment of mange. For the treatment of traumatic keratitis, a solution of acriflavine followed by atropine, and the protection of the eye by a pad of antiphlogistine, are said to be very effective. A disease suggestive of tick paralysis is described. An immediate application of " White Fluid " to remove ticks is recommended. A case of severe debility described was apparently caused by heavy infestation with trichostrongyles Trichophyton infection is commonly demonstrable in camel calves, but is easily cured.-F. J.

AB  - Public health recommendations for Lyme disease prevention generally include daily tick checks and prompt removal of attached ticks as a means of decreasing the risk of acquiring Lyme disease in highly endemic regions. In the current study, we determined whether crushing nymphal ticks during removal with forceps increased the risk of B. burgdorferi transmission, what degree of protection from transmission of B. burgdorferi was provided by removal of nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say at specific intervals, and whether commercial devices marketed for tick removal worked when tested against nymphal I. scapularis. Both removal via gentle pressure (26% transmission) or crushing the tick (30% transmission) caused a significant decrease in transmission as compared with the sham control (70% transmission). The degree of protection provided via tick removal decreased steadily up to 60 h of attachment; between 60 and 66 h, a dramatic falloff in protection occurred to the point where no protection was observed at 66 h. Finally, commercial tick removal devices varied widely in their efficacy for the removal of attached nymphal I. scapudaris.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the occurrence of Bartonella henselae reservoir and vectors of infection in the close surroundings of human beings in urban areas of central Poland. The study included mammals (54 dogs, 137 cats) and 102 adult Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from cats and dogs. Blood samples were drawn from each animal and cultured on chocolate agar plates and in mouse fibroblasts L-929 cell line culture. The levels of Bartonella henselae IgG antibodies were determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Bartonella spp. strains were isolated from blood of 14 cats (10.2%). Isolates were identified by PCR methods as: B. henselae (18), B. clarridgeiae (1). Blood samples from dogs were consistently negative for Bartonella spp. 59 (45.0%) of 131 tested cats had B. henselae antibodies. B. henselae antibodies were present in 50% of tested dogs, although mostly (96.2%) in low titres ≤1:64. In 4.9% of Ixodes ricinus ticks examined, B. henselae DNA was detected. These data demonstrate that in the urban area of central Poland B. henselae occurs in environmental sources, both in cats and dogs (reservoir) and ticks (possible vector).

AB  - Background. Tick-borne encephalitis is a viral disease. The most common way of passing the illness through is being bitten by an infected tick. Fast tick removal cannot be a protection against the infection. There is no causal treatment of a tick-borne encephalitis. The best way of protection against this infection is to carry out a full prophylactic vaccination course. Objectives. The aim of this study was to define the amount of children who were vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis in a population of children belonging to NZOZ AD -MED in Wroclaw in 2006-2010. Material and methods. We analyzed immunization cards of children. Material was gathered according to immunization cards of 659 children. Results. 54 children under 18 were vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis in 2006-2010 (8.19%). In 2006 - only one child (1.85%), in following year 5 children (9.26%). In 2008 21 children were immunized (38.9%), and one more child in 2009 (40.74%). In the first 6 months of 2010 5 were vaccinated (9.26%). Conclusions. The amount of children vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis increased considerably in 2008 and since then it remained on the same level. (copyright) Wydawnictwo Continuo.

AB  - The Healthy People 2010 public health goals targeted a 44% decrease in the incidence of Lyme disease, the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States. To review Lyme disease prevention, clinical trials, epidemiological and experimental studies, and predictive models were evaluated. Geographic distribution of ixodid vectors and local landscape predict Lyme disease risk. Density of infected ticks correlates with incidence and prevalence of Lyme disease, but risk quantitation is made uncertain by tick aggregation and inability to predict tick-human interactions. Outdoor activities are inconsistently or weakly associated with risk, and most infections likely occur in residential areas during routine activities. Tick control (burning or removing vegetation, acaricide use, and deer elimination) reduces Ixodes scapularis populations by up to 94%, and acaricide application to wildlife decreases nymphal I scapularis populations by up to 83%. The effect of these strategies on incidence of Lyme disease in humans is unknown. Studies show that only 40% to 50% of adults take precautions against tick bites even when they are aware of Lyme disease. Effective protection afforded by personal precautions (wearing protective clothing, avoiding ticks, and using insect repellant) has not been shown prospectively. Antimicrobial prophylaxis of tick bites is not warranted. Clinical trials showed vaccines containing recombinant OspA of Borrelia burgdorferi to be efficacious and well tolerated. Currently, vaccination is the only empirically demonstrated method to prevent Lyme disease. The best evidence supports prevention efforts focused on practices that encourage immunization, Lyme disease awareness, and possibly treatment of deer.

AB  - Background: Monocytic ehrlichiosis is an important disease in canine pathology and is present worldwide and has a potentially lethal outcome. This infection as a 'new' infective disease of dogs and people and it has not been suffi ciently researched, especially from the aspect of clinical picture, pathogenesis, diagnostics and differential diagnostics. The aims of this seroepidemiological research of the E. canis infection with dogs are to determine the values of G class antibodies prevalence to E. canis antigens, also to determine a agreement of positive serological fi ndings between two immunodiagnostic tests (iELISA and IFAT), and to make an overview of the epidemiological characteristics of this canine infection. Materials, Methods & Results: One hundred dogs were involved in the seroepidemiological research of the E. canis infection. These dogs were from the City of Novi Sad area and its outskirts, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The epidemiological survey of the closed type has been used in the research. The survey has been conducted with all of the dogs involved in this research. Apart from identifying veterinary practices and the patients (breed, sex, age), the survey was designed to collect data about the tick bites (fi rst bite or a repeated one); the number of the removed ticks; the dogs' lifestyles and information on whether the dogs had been abroad. An overall of 62 ticks were collected from the bodies of these dogs. By applying the screening iELISA test, the seroprevalence of class G specifi c antibodies was determined with dogs to E. canis antigens in 25%, while 75% of dogs were negative to the presence of specifi c antibodies of IgG class to E. canis. Out of 25 seropositive dogs, with antibodies to E. canis discovered through iELISA test, 12 (48%) dogs were in contact with ticks for the fi rst time, while the repeated contact with ticks was experienced by 9 (36%) dogs. For 4 (16%) dogs, the owners negated that their dog had been bitten by a tick. Upon the application of a confi rming IFAT, a seroprevalence was determined of specifi c class G antibodies with dogs to E. canis antigens in 16%, while 84% were negative to the presence of specifi c antibodies of IgG class antibodies to E. canis. Out of 16 seropositive dogs, in which antibodies were discovered with IFAT to E. canis, 9 (56%) dogs had been in contact with ticks for the fi rst time, while 4 dogs (25%) had repeated contacts with ticks. For 3 dogs (19%), the owners negated that ticks had bitten their dogs. Through a statistical processing of the results gained from the applied immunodiagnostic tests, a moderate agreement (Kappa value of 0.48) was determined. In the group of dogs that had been bitten by a tick, three types were determined: Dermacentor marginatus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ixodes ricinus. Overall 35 ticks of Dermacentor marginatus ticks were replaced from the dogs' bodies just as were 15 Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks and 12 Ixodes ricinus ticks. Discussion: The determined values of the seroprevalence in our country (iELISA - 25% and IFAT - 16%) are in harmony with the acquired values in other countries with warm climate. The values of seroprevalence determined in this research point to the fact that this disease must be taken into consideration in everyday health protection of dogs, especially after a registered tick bite within a differential diagnostics procedure.

AB  - Introduction: Unnecessary laboratory utilization due to inappropriate test-ordering behaviour among hospital clinicians and community general practitioners is an ongoing problem in many hospitals and primary care trusts throughout the UK and abroad. In January 2007, our hospital removed the 'tick box' for PSA from its laboratory tests request form, in a managed way, with the intention of reducing unnecessary requests for this test. Here we address the impact this action had on the number of PSA tests being requested and its downstream effects on prostate cancer diagnosis. Methods: Using our laboratory database we compared the number of hospital and local GP requests for PSA, before and after modification of our laboratory form (requests from 2004 to 2006 were compared to 2007). We then correlated this data with the number of fast-track target referrals (2 week wait) from primary care for suspected prostate cancer, the results of prostate biopsies, and the number of prostate cancers being diagnosed, over the same time period. Results: Mann-Whitney non-parametric testing demonstrated a 17% reduction in the median number of PSA requests since the change was introduced (p= 0.001). Subset analysis revealed an 18% reduction in GP requests (p= 0.002). However no change was found in the number of prostate cancer diagnoses being made (p= 0.86) and the number of target referrals for suspected prostate cancer (p= 0.59) in the months of April, May, June, July, August and September of 2004-2006 as compared to the same months in 2007. The rate of patients undergoing biopsy increased in the post intervention period from 15.5 to 18.5 patients per month. The rate of negative biopsies remained stable, changing from 7.2 to 7.3 per month, and the rate of positive biopsies increased from 8.3 to 11.2 per month. This change reduced the false negative rate (suspected cancer, negative biopsy) from 46% to 40% in the period following the intervention. The rate of target referrals leading on to cancer showed a small increase after the intervention from 2.9 to 3.3 per month. Conclusions: Our study shows that with this simple modification to the design of our laboratory request form, whereby the doctor must make an active written decision to order a PSA test, there was a significant reduction in the number of PSA requests, both in the hospital and in the community, without patient safety being compromised as measured by maintaining the number of fast-track target referrals for suspected prostate cancer and the number of prostate cancers diagnosed. © 2011.

AB  - Tick infestation of ocular tissues is not common. Tick inoculation of the skin can locally lead to granuloma and abscess formation. More concerning, however, is the potential systemic sequelae that can result from transmission of zoonoses such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Ehrlichia, and tularemia. To avoid these complications, it is critical that the tick is completely removed. The authors present a case of tick infestation in the eyelid of a 55-year-old woman and review the management of such a case.

AB  - Patients with illnesses caused by ticks may present with flulike symptoms. Physicians should learn how to recognize these illnesses by specific aspects in the patients' histories and physical examinations. Prevention of mortality and morbidity may depend on correct early diagnosis and treatment. Illness prevention may result with early removal of the tick, because infection usually requires 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host. A bite from one tick may transmit several different pathogens leading to concurrent infections. The prevention of tick-borne illnesses can start with advice on how to prevent tick bites, especially during summer time. Copyright 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was made of the external and anatomical changes that take place with age in adults of Dermacentor pictus (Herm.) (from the time of attachment up to 2 years of age) to ascertain whether a rapid method for the determination of physiological age could be devised. Adults from a laboratory population and from a wild population were used. The epidermis was removed from ticks in physiological solution in petri dishes covered with paraffin wax. The internal organs were examined while immersed, and particular structures were examined by phase-contrast microscopy. For histological examination, ticks were fixed in a mercuric chloride mixture ("Suza"), sectioned in paraffin and stained with azocarmine. Changes with age were found in the colour and density of the cuticle, the volume and colour of the intestinal processes, the degree of filling of the Malpighian tubes and rectal cyst and the degree of development of loose connective tissue and its elements. The changes were similar in males and females. The main feature of such changes was their association with the utilisation of nutrient reserves and the accumulation of excretory products. In both ticks and insects, such changes are irreversible. The data obtained indicate the possibility of using these age changes for estimating the physiological age of all species of Ixodes and perhaps of all species of Ixodoidea.

AB  - An experimental technique was developed using simultaneously 2 different radioisotopes (Cr 51 to attach to red blood cells and I 125 for labelling plasma) to determine the amount of blood removed by feeding ticks ( Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Amblyomma hebraeum and Hyalomma truncatum). Using this method, the volumes of erythrocytes and plasma in the ticks were measured sensitively and directly (unlike colorimetric and gravimetric methods), and the ratio between the 2 parameters (concentrating ability) calculated. Nymphs and females of R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum concentrated blood by 1.9-2.3 times, by returning back into the host a third to half of the fluid intake.

AB  - An experimental technique was modified in which 2 different isotopes (Cr 51 and I 125) were used simultaneously as blood markers for determining the amount of blood removed by feeding ticks. This method enables the separate and direct measurement of the volumes of red blood cells and plasma in ticks and the calculation of the ratio between the 2 parameters (concentrating ability). The concentration of red blood cells in nymphs of Amblyomma hebraeum and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and in females of these species plus in those of Hyalomma truncatum were found to be twice the amount measured in the labelled blood of goats. Concentrations of plasma in the ticks were approximately two-thirds of that measured in samples taken directly from these same goats. Small nonsignificant differences between the ability of various tick species to concentrate red blood cells and dilute host plasma were found. The advantage of this method is compared with that of the colorimetric and gravimetric methods, and its potential use is discussed.

AB  - In the USA there are 12 species of ticks which can be vectors of disease syndromes that affect humans, livestock and wildlife. Harmful features of a tick infestation can include local irritation, blood loss, cutaneous wounds, disease transmission and paralysis. The 10 syndromes reviewed which affect humans are Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrilchiosis, tularemia, Q fever, babesiosis, relapsing fever, Colorado tick fever, tick bite paralysis and pajahuello tick bite. Tick control methods can include personal protection, use of chemical repellents, removal of attached ticks, use of insecticides, control of ticks on pets and in buildings, and vegetation management. Tickborne diseases will probably increase in line with the amount of leisure time spent outdoors. Demographic changes may also lead to the increased exposure of man to ticks.

In the future, tick-borne diseases will probably increase as leisure time increases. People will have an opportunity for more outdoor activity, which will expose them to tick infestation. Demographic changes in parts of the country because of land development may also increase exposure to ticks.

AB  - Aim of the study: Employees with an outdoor occupation are at risk of contracting diseases from ticks, such as Lyme's disease (borreliosis). The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of anti borrelia burgdorferi antibodies as an indicator of previous borrelia infections in occupationally exposed persons - employees from the Bavarian water authorities and road maintenance department - and to compare the data with the prevalence in non-exposed workers. In addition, we investigated the influence on antibody prevalence of knowledge about tick-borne diseases, or about protective measures and their use. Protective measures include the avoidance of tick bites and the rapid removal of attached ticks. Methods and collective: The study population (84 % men, mean age 42 years) was assigned to 2 groups: 326 persons occupationally exposed to ticks, and 205 colleagues who mainly worked inside. Markers for infection were borrelia antibodies in the ELISA test, and, in the case of sero-prevalence, positive confirmation with an immunoblot. Results: Workers who spent at least half of the time outdoors reported more tick bites over the last two years than their colleagues, but the incidence of infection was not higher (14%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that neither tick bites during the last two years nor differences in knowledge about tick-borne diseases and protective measures influenced the incidence of infection. Conclusions: The only independent risk factor for borrelia infection was a longer duration of employment. Prospective studies should be carried out to discover if better knowledge about protective measures and their constant implementation reduces the infection risk.

AB  - Against parasites of sheep such as the Hippoboscid, Melophagus, and the louse, Tricfiodectes, the author deprecates the use of insecticide powders and ointments and recommends dipping. Titrated extract of nicotine of State manufacture, 0.5 gal., and water, 100 gals., can be used as a bath, the sheep being dipped twice at eight days' interval, care being taken that none of the liquid is swallowed by the animals. The most efficacious bath is composed of carbolic acid 20.5 gals., black soap 10 Ib., water 200 gals. The black soap and phenic acid are separately dissolved in a little warm water, the two solutions are then mixed and the rest of the water added. The bath should be kept warm by occasional additions of hot quantities of the solution. The animals should be kept in it for some minutes in order to soak ilie fleece, shearing being unnecessary. To prevent re-infestation, the folds should be thoroughly cleaned and washed down with milk of lime. For Ixodes the usual methods of control are removal of the ticks by hand or covering them with a drop of oil, benzine and petrol mixture, or baths, using either the carbolic formula given above or an arsenical dip composed of arsenic anhydride 4 Ib., carbonate of"Soda.10 Ib., Norwegian tar 3 3/8 gals., water 180 gals. The usual precautions in using this poisonous solution must be taken.

AB  - A growth curve was established for B. microplus developing on cattle, and length limits were derived which allowed allocation of ticks removed from the host to a probable age category. A separate set of length limits was derived for ticks which had been fixed and processed by a method which dissolved hair, and removed the ticks from skin. Cattle infested daily with a constant number of larvae yielded a relatively constant number of engorged adult females. The age structures of populations of ticks on animals of different resistance levels, and which had achieved such a population balance, were analysed to determine the stages of development against which resistance was manifest. All animals rejected larvae within 24 hours of infestation and the effect was greater on resistant animals. Resistant animals also rejected nymphs and adults at the time of attachment but those instars were not affected on animals of low resistance. Once a particular instar was established it was able to complete development within that instar, except on one highly resistant animal which rejected nymphs progressively. On two animals there was an accumulation of young adult females of a size equivalent to 14 days' development.

AB  - Experimental observations on over 100 dogs indicate that the first symptoms of paralysis do not occur earlier than the fourth and usually on the fifth day after the attachment of the adult female tick. The shortest period, early on the fourth day, was observed when 81 ticks were allowed to engorge on a puppy weighing about 6-5 Ib. Among lay dog owners, the idea is prevalent that paralysis may supervene after a few hours' attachment. This idea is apparently due to ignorance of many dog owners of the gradual process of engorgement of the tick, of the true identity of partially gorged and engorged ticks, which are often considered as different species, and also to their belief in the infallibility of the methods adopted by them for the removal of ticks.-H.

AB  - Ticks are blood feeding external parasites which can cause local and systemic complications to human body. A lot of tick-borne human diseases include Lyme disease and virus encephalitis, can be transmitted by a tick bite. Also secondary bacterial skin infection, reactive manifestations against tick allergens, and granuloma's formation can be occurred. Tick paralysis is a relatively rare complication but it can be fatal. Except the general rules for tick bite prevention, any tick found should be immediately and completely removed alive. Furthermore, the lick removal technique should not allow or provoke the escape of infective body fluids through the tick into the wound site, and disclose any local complication. Many methods of tick removal (a lot of them are unsatisfactory and/or dangerous) have been reported in the literature, but there is very limited experimental evidence to support these methods. No technique will remove completely every tick. So, there is not an appropriate and absolutely effective and/or safe tick removal technique. Regardless of the used tick removal technique, clinicians should be aware of the clinical signs of tick-transmitted diseases, the public should be informed about the risks and the prevention of tick borne diseases, and persons who have undergone tick removal should be monitored up to 30 days for signs and symptoms.

AB  - Ticks are blood feeding external parasites which can cause local and systemic complications to human body. A lot of tick-borne human diseases include Lyme disease and virus encephalitis, can be transmitted by a tick bite. Also secondary bacterial skin infection, reactive manifestations against tick allergens, and granuloma's formation can be occurred. Tick paralysis is a relatively rare complication but it can be fatal. Except the general rules for tick bite prevention, any tick found should be immediately and completely removed alive. Furthermore, the tick removal technique should not allow or provoke the escape of infective body fluids through the tick into the wound site, and disclose any local complication. Many methods of tick removal (a lot of them are unsatisfactory and/or dangerous) have been reported in the literature, but there is very limited experimental evidence to support these methods. No technique will remove completely every tick. So, there is not an appropriate and absolutely effective and/or safe tick removal technique. Regardless of the used tick removal technique, clinicians should be aware of the clinical signs of tick-transmitted diseases, the public should be informed about the risks and the prevention of tick borne diseases, and persons who have undergone tick removal should be monitored up to 30 days for signs and symptoms.

AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus, an emerging pathogen in several countries in Europe and Asia, has been divided into three subtypes (European, Siberian and Far Eastern). These subtypes are associated with different severities of the disease. For that reason, early determination of the subtype in a clinical sample or in ticks removed from a patient in areas of co-circulation of two or three subtypes is of high importance. The development of a simple method of multiplex RT-PCR for rapid and easy subtyping of tick-borne encephalitis virus isolates is reported to fill this requirement. The method is based on the unique combination of oligonucleotide primers hybridizing with subtype-specific "signature" positions of the sequence encoding the viral envelope protein. The developed multiplex RT-PCR also appears to be a useful method in studies focused on the molecular-epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis virus.

AB  - This paper is a general review of tick-transmitted diseases and means of prevention and is largely historical. The author gives the following list of ticks and their hosts known in South Africa. Margaropus annulatus, var. decoloratus: horses, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs and antelopes. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus: hares and lions in addition to the foregoing. Rhipicephalus evertsi: attacking horses, cattle, sheep, goats, antelopes and hares. Rhipicephalus simus: horses, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, jackals, wild dogs and hedgehogs. Amblyomma hebraeum: horses, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, wild dogs, antelopes and ostriches. The ticks are especially common at the beginning of summer, when the heat and moisture required for their development are present. The greater the altitude and the more bare the soil, the fewer ticks there will be, but M. annulatus, the commonest tick of South Africa, had been found at all altitudes; Rhipicephalus evertsi is much less. common and R. appendiculatus is rarely met with on elevated plateaux, but it is specially found in valleys where the vegetation is abundant. Rhipicephalus simus and Amblyomma hebraeum are chiefly found on broad sandy plains covered by a scanty vegetation. It has been noticed that the number of ticks increases proportionally with the number of head of cattle, and apart from their capacity for transmitting disease, they are very harmful to cattle in consequence of the quantity of blood which they extract. It has been calculated that in one year, the ticks on one beast are capable of removing 48 litres of blood and some ticks are capable of drawing as much as 2 cubic centimetres. Theiler mentions the case of a horse which died of acute anaemia as the consequence of an extraordinary attack by M. decoloratus. The ticks collected from this animal weighed 20 kilos (44 Ib.). The eggs were unharmed under 4 months' exposure to a temperature of 0° C., and the same temperature does not kill either larva, nymph or adult. Prolonged immersion in water apparently has little effect upon them. The author divides the ticks into 3 classes, according to whether they require one, two, or three hosts to complete their life-cycle. He says that the important facts to be known in the life-history of the tick are the dates of oviposition and hatching; the time required to complete the life-cycle on the host; the time that larva and nymph remain upon the host, and the time required by them, after quitting their host, to complete their respective metamorphoses; the time required by the female to gorge and detach herself; and lastly, the time that the larval, nymphal, and adult forms can survive. The author then proceeds to deal with the life-history of the following ticks. Margaropus annulatus var. decoloratus. This tick requires one host and takes 3 weeks to pass from larva to adult; after 3 weeks the gorged females commence to quit their host and by the fourth week all have done so. Five days after this, the female oviposits at all events in the hot season. In summer, the eggs hatch in from 3 to 6 weeks, taking longer in winter. Young larvae kept in the laboratory may live as long as six months. In the open they station themselves on a plant and wait for a host. They do not feed on the juices of plants and perish if, after six months, they fail to find a host. Rhipicephalus evertsi requires 2 hosts. In summer the eggs hatch 30 days after oviposition. The young larvae can live 7 months without food. They become nymphs on their host and these are found close to the point to which the larva was attached. The nymph falls off in from 16 to 21 days, moulting to the adult stage requires 24 days and the adult gorges itself and falls to the ground in from 6 to 10 days and is capable of living for a whole year on the soil apart from a host. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, capensis, nitens. These ticks require 3 hosts, the adult females gorging themselves in 4 days. The eggs hatch in the warm season in about 28 days, or several months in winter. Sixteen to twenty days later the larva becomes a nymph. In the laboratory the larvae have been kept for 7 months and nymphs for 6 months. Both the young larvae and nymphs are sluggish and not capable of attaching themselves for some days. The nymph requires 3 to 6 days for engorgement and, leaving its host, becomes adult 18 days later and then gorges itself in 7 days. The adults have been kept alive in the laboratory for 14 months. R. simus also requires 3 hosts. The eggs hatch in summer 30 days after oviposition. The larva becomes a nymph in 20 days, and the nymph an adult in 25 days more. Amblyomma hebraeum, is also a 3 host species. In summer the female lays her eggs 2 weeks after quitting the host, or 3 months in winter, hatching taking place in about 10 weeks or 6 months respectively. The larvae have been known to live 7 months, and remain 7 days on their host when found. Twenty-five days later the first moult occurs, but if conditions are. unfavourable this may be delayed for 4 months. The nymph gorges itself in from 4 to 20 days and may live 6 months without a host. The adult appears 25 days later in summer or as much as 160 days in winter, gorges itself in from 10 to 20 days, and may live several months. The author then goes on to discuss the transmission of disease, which is intimately associated with the mode of life of the tick. Where the tick has only one host, the disease can only be transmitted to one host by the same individual, but if the tick have two or three hosts it is possible for the same tick to transmit the disease to different animals. It is only by accident, or as the result of experiment, that a tick will change its host in one of its stages. It appears however that male ticks can and do pass from one host to another. The propagation of tick-borne diseases is greatly increased by the capacity of ticks for transmitting infection to their offspring. This is the case with piroplasmosis, anaplasmosis, and spirillosis transmitted in South Africa by M. annulatus, as well as Rabesia canis, transmitted by Haemaphysalis leachi. The infection acquired from the parent does not reappear in some species except in the adult; thus H. leachi, though capable of hereditary infection, is not infective except in the adult stage. Some authors believe that in the case of this tick it is the only possible mode of infection, but Christophers is of opinion that the adult "tick, if fed in its nymphal stage upon a dog suffering from piroplasmosis, can transmit the disease as an adult without regard to any hereditary infection. Tick-borne diseases may be divided into two categories, those which, after recovery, leave the animals still infected and a source of contagion for the ticks, and those in which the cure is complete and the parasites are entirely eliminated from the blood. In the first category are the diseases due to: - Piroplasma bovis, equi, ovis, canis, Anaplasma marginalia and centrolis, Theileria mutans, and spirillosis of cattle; in the second category, East Coast fever ( Theileria parva) and heartwater. This explains the fact that animals imported into a district in Africa where there is no known case of acute piroplasmosis have acquired the disease, the reason being that they are bitten by ticks which have been infected from animals which have recovered from the disease, but are still carrying the virus in their blood. The author then proceeds to discuss the various methods of treating animals attacked by ticks as follows: -Removal of the ticks by hand; Lounsbury's method, which consists in smearing the skin with a mixture of oil and sulphur; Gordon's method of rubbing with petroleum. These three methods are all open to the same objection in that they are expensive and hardly capable of application to a large number of animals. The burning of herbage is regarded by some as a certain remedy and there is no doubt that enormous numbers may be destroyed in this way. but the author thinks that the value of the remedy has been exaggerated. Bush fires at the end of the hot season will kill all the young larvae attached to the herbage, but numbers of females have fallen to the ground and their eggs, as well as the ticks which are attached to the cattle, escape and the eggs hatch more rapidly, as the cover having been destroyed, they are exposed directly to the sun's rays. Firing the herbage undoubtedly diminishes the number of ticks, but in order to obtain satisfactory results, it is necessary to carry out the operation as late as possible, and this question is the subject of much discussion in South Africa. The most practical and most extensively employed method is dipping; the author gives the following formulae for dips. Three day dip: Arsenite of soda 4 Ib., soft soap 3 Ib., petroleum 1 gallon, water 400 gallons. Five day dip: Arsenite of soda 8 Ib., soft soap 5 1/2 Ib., petroleum 2 gallons, water 400 gallons. The author then discusses the action of arsenical dips upon ticks and says that the ticks are killed by the direct action of the arsenite. In the numerous experiments which have been made, it has been proved that, after the use of a dip with arsenite of soda as a base, the number of female ticks which gorge themselves diminishes considerably, the young females dying before reaching this stage. The already gorged females are killed, or if they survive and lay eggs, these are few in number and many do not hatch, the larvae resulting from the remainder being feeble and hardly able to escape from the egg. The author says that as M. annulatus var. decoloratus requires 3 or 4 weeks to complete its metamorphosis, one dipping every 3 weeks is sufficient, but seeing that the young larva may live for 6 months and the adult nearly a year before attaching themselves to a host, the dip must be kept up for at least this period. In the case of R. evertsi dipping is necessary at least every 8 days and must be continued for at least a year. R. appendiculatus, the chief carrier of East Coast fever, requires 3 hosts and dipping every 3 days is required in order to catch the tick in all stages of its existence, and this must be continued for at least 14 months. For A. hebmeum, dipping every 4 days, for 7 months at least, is required. It is thus obvious that before deciding on the frequency of dipping, the tick to be destroyed must be determined. It has been shown that animals can stand dipping every 5 days, but as a matter of practice they are dipped every 8th day and the treatment completed by hand. If an epidemic of East Coast fever should break out, it is absolutely necessary to dip the cattle every 3 days. In conclusion the author reviews an objection which has been raised against dipping, since if it be regularly practised, large numbers of non-immune animals will be produced and these if transferred to a tick infested district, may acquire the diseases in an exceedingly virulent form. The author thinks that this objection, which at first sight is very serious, may be easily refuted, because the movements of cattle will always be dangerous as the virulence of disease is not everywhere the same and it is possible that an animal may be immunized against the organism of one country and not that of another, and animals having a latent infection are more susceptible to adverse conditions. The destruction of ticks also makes the introduction of European cattle possible, whereas under existing conditions such introduction is difficult. If however such imported cattle could, on their arrival ' in Africa, be at once distributed to regions where there are no ticks and no trypanosomiasis, they could live and breed as in Europe. The author quotes a case from the Transvaal in which 20 Hereford cattle were imported from England direct, 3 years ago, and have done exceedingly well; the only precaution taken being rigorous protection against ticks. He concludes with an earnest appeal to all cattle-raisers to support universal dipping.

AB  - The following is based partly on the authors' summary. In May-July 1964, 12 cases of tularaemia were diagnosed, mainly among children, on two Indian Reservations in South Dakota, an area where the incidence of the disease is usually low. Ticks were removed from the site of ulceration in seven instances, and there was a history of exposure to ticks in two others. One of the remaining cases was apparently due to the bite of a deer fly ( Chrysops) and another to the bite of an unidentified insect. Field investigations revealed an unusual degree of tick activity. Nine of some 50 lots of Dermacentor variabilis (Say) collected from vegetation, dog and horse were positive for Bacterium (Pasteurella) tularense. A high proportion of dog and horse sera had tularaemia-agglutinating antibodies. The occurrence of the human cases in an area relatively free of tularaemia in the past is ascribed to a sharp rise in the numbers of D. variabilis and the frequent exposure of the human population, particularly the Indians and their children who live near and frequent the areas of denser vegetation, to the large numbers of ticks located in those areas. The presence of infection with B. tularense in wild-caught examples of Melophagus ovinus (L.) and Aedes trivittatus (Coq.) has been shown by serological tests with the tissues of experimental animals into which suspensions of insects had been injected; tularaemia has been associated with mosquitos in Sweden [ RAE B 27 138, etc.] and the Soviet Union [52 106], and mechanical transmission of the bacterium has been demonstrated experimentally with common species of Montana mosquitos [21 23], but there has previously been no reference in the literature to the identification of B. tularense in naturally infected mosquitos or sheep keds. M. E. Soules reports that central and eastern Montana also experienced a season of great tick activity with associated outbreaks of tularaemia in sheep and in men working with sheep. The vector in this case was D. andersoni Stiles, and human infection was associated with the sheep industry.

AB  - CASE REPORT: We describe a patient who was bitten on his right upper eyelid by a common canine tick. The tick was impregnated with gasoline prior to being removed.
DISCUSSION: Tick bites are uncommon in ophthalmologic practice. They occur more frequently in rural areas, especially in spring and summer. Correct identification of the problem and treatment is essential. The tick needs to be completely removed in order to avoid the embedding of different parts of the insect. Zoonoses, such as rickettsiosis, arbovirus and paralysis due to ticks must be ruled out.

AB  - Various methods of feeding ticks are reviewed from the literature, and accounts are given of the technique found most satisfactory by the author in his studies of the life-histories of common Indian species. Difficulty was experienced chiefly in the case of intermittent feeders, and capsules resembling those described by F. A. Morton in a paper already noticed [ R.A.E. B 17 124] were found useful for these. Those used on bullocks are of iron or tin, 3 ins. in diameter and 1/2 in. deep with a rim about 1/4 in. wide all round. A circular piece 1 in. in diameter is removed from the top and replaced by copper gauze to admit air. To allow the ticks to attach themselves, they are confined to the shaved skin under a piece of linen, before the capsule is applied and the animal is prevented from interfering-with the capsule by means of a neck-rack. The capsule can be removed daily and the engorged ticks removed. Wooden capsules 2 ins. in diameter and 1/4 in. in depth and in thickness of wall, with small holes bored in them to admit air, are substituted for metal ones for feeding on dogs and goats, a coat specially prepared to prevent scratching and a leather or cardboard collar being necessary on the former. To feed Argasid ticks on rabbits, the animal is tied on a board with a neck collar. The ticks are collected in a petri dish, which is inverted over a shaved area on the abdomen and held in place with a bandage. The bandage is removed after about half an hour and the engorged ticks collected. Adults of -Argas persicus Oken, are fed on fowls in large glass jars with metal lids having the centre area fitted with gauze to admit air. The fowl, with its head in a cloth bag, is placed with the ticks on a perforated platform and left overnight.

AB  - Ticks have been for some years a serious drawback to the raising of cattle in the French Antilles, very little having been done in many of the Islands to combat them. The usual method has been to remove the ticks by hand or with a knife, after which the infested parts are rubbed with a weak solution of disinfectant liquid. This method has left much to be desired; it cannot be thorough in practice, while in the case of Amblyomma variegatum the mouth-parts of the ticks remain in the skin of the host when the tick is removed and frequently cause a poisoned wound. The establishment of a dipping apparatus has resulted, after 12 months' use, in a great improvement in the condition of the cattle, and it is suggested that horses and. mules might with advantage be treated in the same way. Particulars are given of one of the standard types of dipping apparatus.

AB  - Ticks have been for a number of years a serious drawback to cattle raising in the French Antilles, and very little appears to have been done in many Islands in order to combat them. The result has been that the tick has always gained more or less the upper hand. The method usually employed has been to remove the ticks either by hand or with a knife, the infested parts being then rubbed with a weak solution of a disinfectant fluid. This method has left much to be desired inasmuch as eradication thereby can only be partial and, moreover, in the case of the common tick found at Antigua-the " gold " or " Senegal" tick ( Amhlyomma variegatum) -the mouth parts remain in the skin of the host when the tick is removed and frequently cause a suppurating wound. During the tick season animals exhibit grave anaemia and loss of condition owing to the tick infestation. The author describes the construction of a spraying apparatus which after about twelve months use has effected a great improvement in the condition of the cattle. The standard type of apparatus is erected in a kraal 84 by 75 ft. surrounded by a fence 5 ft. 8 inches high. The kraal is divided into two equal parts, viz., the receiving kraal and the drying kraal. The entrance chute to the apparatus is 13 ft. long and the exit chute 15 ft. In the corner of the receiving kraal nearest the entrance chute there is an " assembly " kraal 43 ft. by 20 ft. The entrance and exit chutes to the apparatus are both furnished with sloping sides, are 1 ft. in width at the bottom, broadening to 3 1/2 ft. at the top, in order to prevent the animals turning back. The chute, which is cemented, is provided with apertures on both sides situated at about the height of the breast of an animal for the introduction of bars in order to hold back the animals if necessary. These bars are also useful in dealing with unruly animals. The bath itself, which is 12 ft. long, is made of galvanised iron; it is 1 ft. broad at its base, and 3 ft. 6 inches at its upper part, and 6 ft. high. The tick-destroying fluid is administered in the form of a spray by means of very fine jets attached to pipes running through the interior of the apparatus, the spray from the jets emerging in fan-shaped fashion. The jets are situated at various angles in such a manner that the whole of the interior can be filled with a spray which is so effective that an animal passing through the bath would be drenched all over in a few seconds. The surplus fluid runs away through the floor of the apparatus and passes through a series of filters composed of metallic gauze into the reservoir and can be employed afresh. Sometimes dust and debris, especially from the animals' feet, block up the jets, but the obstruction can be easily removed. The spraying fluid is pumped from a reservoir situated at the side of the apparatus by means of a pump which necessitates the employment of two men in order to maintain a constant high pressure. The reservoir is made of galvanised iron furnished with an indicator to show the volume of fluid. The floor of the kraal is composed partly of stone and partly of earth and is free from all vegetation. The preparation used for spraying was made from a proprietary mixture " Coopers New Cattle Dip, " a sample of which when analysed gave 19.3 per cent. arsenic in the form of arsenious oxide. In Antigua a solution made by mixing one part of the powder with 140 parts of cold water was considered effective. Inasmuch as the surplus liquid drains away through the gauze filter back into the reservoir, and each animal treated carries away about half a gallon of liquid on its skin, the cost of spraying per head is very small-about 0.03 franc per head for each spraying, or an annual cost of 1 franc 80 per head. In the case of animals sprayed for the first time the operation is repeated in ten days; those that have been sprayed several times are re-sprayed at intervals of about three weeks. It was estimated that on one occasion 73 head of cattle passed through the apparatus in seven minutes and were effectively and completely sprayed. In ordinary weather conditions the animals are dry after 10 to 15 minutes. With few precautions the number of accidents may be reduced so as to be almost negligible. Hitherto cattle only have been sprayed by this means and after & second or third spraying no ticks were found on animals so treated. It is suggested that horses and mules might with advantage be similarly treated. The total cost of the spraying apparatus and the material necessary for erecting the kraals is estimated not to exceed <pounds>70.

AB  - Tick-borne infections are endemic in Switzerland with borreliosis being the most frequent one, followed by the vaccine-preventable tick-borne encephalitis and more rarely by anaplasmosis, rickettsioses and babesiosis. Short characteristics of these infections are presented. The main preventive measures for stays in endemic regions include not leaving forest tracks and wearing closely fitted clothes and shoes, impregnated with an insecticide. Following at-risk activities, clothes as well as the body should be searched for ticks and they have to be removed using a tick removing tool. The body area of the tick bite has to be observed and a physician visit is strongly urged in case of rising fever and/or of erythema migrans. Hantavirus infections: Nephropathia epidemica is a zoonosis caused by the Puumala type of hantavirus and transmission occurs by inhaling aerolized excretions of the bank vole. There is no known human to human transmission. The incidence of this infection varies in a cyclic fashion and typical clinical symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, abdominal and back pain and transient renal impairment with initial oliguria and later polyuria. At-risk activities include camping and cleaning of rodent infestations. In these cases, face masks should be worn and the excretions be moistened before cleaning is started. In Germany, 2 - 3 years-cycles of outbreaks were observed between 2005 and 2012 with regional clusters approaching Switzerland. Therefore, disease awareness of physicians and infection surveillance are essential.

AB  - This method of housing spirochaete-infected ticks consists essentially of the use of a miniature limestone cavern, simulating their normal habitat, the entrance and floor of which are covered with limestone dust collected from the same place as the original ticks. The cavern rests on a board overlying a layer of sand, which can be kept moist. The whole structure is placed in a galvanized iron box. The ticks are fed on white rats, by placing the latter in a "hardware cloth" cylinder of 1/2 in. mesh in front of the cavern. Precautions designed to prevent the ticks escaping, after removal of the rats, are outlined.-M. L. BINGHAM.

AB  - A statewide cross-sectional study of risk factors for seropositivity for antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi in outdoor workers in New Jersey was performed in September and October 1988. The crude odds ratio associated with exposure to ticks on the primary state job was 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-9.0). After adjustment for multiple confounding variables with logistic regression, the adjusted occupational tick exposure odds ratio was 5.1 (95% CI 1.1-23.6). Additional analyses revealed that any use of insect repellent or antibiotics may have decreased the risk of Lyme disease in these workers (adjusted odds ratios for not using insect repellent or antibiotics were 2.0 (95% CI 1.0-4.0) and 2.3 (95% CI 0.8-6.7), respectively). These data suggest that Lyme disease is a hazard of outdoor work and that increased recognition of this fact will be necessary to prevent Lyme disease in these workers.

AB  - This case report describes a 10-year-old horse that developed multiple dermal papules over the right masseter area following removal of a tick from the same site 3 months earlier. Histological examination of a biopsy from a papule was suggestive of either a T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma or cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, a form of pseudolymphoma sometimes associated with a tick bite. Positive serological testing and PCR of the biopsy sample for Borrelia in conjunction with immunohistochemical testing of the skin biopsy, the clinical history and response to treatment with doxycycline strongly supported the diagnosis of Borrelia-associated cutaneous pseudolymphoma.

AB  - In the first of these publications, which is the third part of a series [ cf. R.A.E., B 40 72], the ticks and mites that are injurious to domestic animals and poultry in Australia, are reviewed; notes are given on such points as their distribution and abundance, their bionomics as observed in Australia, the effects they produce on the host or the diseases they carry, and the control measures generally used against them, if any. Brief notes are also given on Linguatula serrata Frol. (the nymphs of which are present and not uncommon in cattle in all States, though the only records of adults are in dogs in New South Wales, dogs and foxes in Victoria, and a dingo in South Australia) and on other animals (vertebrate and invertebrate) that are harmful to stock. The latter include a few insects, chiefly species that sometimes cause the death of animals that eat them; the only one that is stated to present a serious problem and is discussed at any length is the sawfly, Platypsectra interrupta (Klug), the larvae of which poison cattle in one part of Queensland [ cf. 26 149, etc.-]. More than half the publication is devoted to an account of the introduction (probably in 3872) and spread of the cattle tick, Boophilus annulat us micro-plus (Can.) ( D. a. australis (Fuller)), which is established in the north of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, in the north and east of Queensland and in the north-eastern tip of New South Wales, and the measures that have been taken to control it in various States and to eradicate it from New South Wales [ cf. 16 193]. Owing to the presence of an arsenic-resistant strain in Queensland, where dipping is carried out privately, DDT is preferred to arsenic there [36 103-105]. Various other toxicants have also been tried [41 180-181, 195]. Their effectiveness and their effect on stock are reviewed. In New South Wales, where dipping is compulsory and carried out by the government, arsenic-resistance is unknown and dips containing arsenic are used because they ensure success, are simple to prepare and are easier to analyse and much less costly than DDT dips. Regulations made from 3896 onwards with a view to preventing the southward spread of the tick are reviewed in detail. Entry of cattle from infested areas of Queensland into New South Wales was prohibited at first but was allowed after dipping in certain circumstances from 1902. Infestation subsequently spread into New South Wales, and parts of the State were quarantined. The main provisions now operating regarding border crossings from Queensland are given. Measures of control within New South Wales are discussed by periods (1906-1919, 1920-1926 and 1927 onwards) with details of measures taken and changes in quarantine areas. Attempts to control individual introductions and extensions met with varied success, but it was not until 1932 that an adequate eradication programme with dipping of all stock (cattle, horses and sheep) in an infested area every 14 days for ten months was put into operation. Since that time, 5, 370 of the 9, 945 sq. miles at one time quarantined have been released. Some changes in the duration of the treatment period have been made where ten months was found to be inadequate. Some areas in which frequent mustering was impracticable were cleared by removing stock until all ticks on the land had died of starvation. The two remaining parts deal with protozoan and virus diseases and with bacterial diseases of domestic animals and poultry in Australia. The vectors of most of those that are Arthropod-borne are briefly discussed. Among the protozoan diseases, most attention is given to piroplasmosis and anaplasmosis, which occur only in cattle in Australia, where they are caused by Piroplasma (Babcsia) bigeminum, P. (B.) argentinum and Anaplasma marginale and are transmitted by Boophilus annulatus microphis. Antibodies of Murray Valley encephalitis [42 15] have recently been detected in horses in Victoria, New South Wales and central Queensland and in dogs, as well as in fowls.

Owing to the presence of an arsenic-resistant strain in Queensland, where dipping is carried out privately, DDT is preferred to arsenic there [36 103-105]. Various other toxicants have also been tried [41 180-181, 195]. Their effectiveness and their effect on stock are reviewed. In New South Wales, where dipping is compulsory and carried out by the government, arsenic-resistance is unknown and dips containing arsenic are used because they ensure success, are simple to prepare and are easier to analyse and much less costly than DDT dips. Regulations made from 3896 onwards with a view to preventing the southward spread of the tick are reviewed in detail. Entry of cattle from infested areas of Queensland into New South Wales was prohibited at first but was allowed after dipping in certain circumstances from 1902. Infestation subsequently spread into New South Wales, and parts of the State were quarantined. The main provisions now operating regarding border crossings from Queensland are given. Measures of control within New South Wales are discussed by periods (1906-1919, 1920-1926 and 1927 onwards) with details of measures taken and changes in quarantine areas. Attempts to control individual introductions and extensions met with varied success, but it was not until 1932 that an adequate eradication programme with dipping of all stock (cattle, horses and sheep) in an infested area every 14 days for ten months was put into operation. Since that time, 5, 370 of the 9, 945 sq. miles at one time quarantined have been released. Some changes in the duration of the treatment period have been made where ten months was found to be inadequate. Some areas in which frequent mustering was impracticable were cleared by removing stock until all ticks on the land had died of starvation. The two remaining parts deal with protozoan and virus diseases and with bacterial diseases of domestic animals and poultry in Australia. The vectors of most of those that are Arthropod-borne are briefly discussed. Among the protozoan diseases, most attention is given to piroplasmosis and anaplasmosis, which occur only in cattle in Australia, where they are caused by Piroplasma (Babcsia) bigeminum, P. (B.) argentinum and Anaplasma marginale and are transmitted by Boophilus annulatus microphis. Antibodies of Murray Valley encephalitis [42 15] have recently been detected in horses in Victoria, New South Wales and central Queensland and in dogs, as well as in fowls.

AB  - In the first of these publications, which is the third part of a series [ cf. R.A.E., B 40 72], the ticks and mites that are injurious to domestic animals and poultry in Australia, are reviewed; notes are given on such points as their distribution and abundance, their bionomics as observed in Australia, the effects they produce on the host or the diseases they carry, and the control measures generally used against them, if any. Brief notes are also given on Linguatula serrata Frol. (the nymphs of which are present and not uncommon in cattle in all States, though the only records of adults are in dogs in New South Wales, dogs and foxes in Victoria, and a dingo in South Australia) and on other animals (vertebrate and invertebrate) that are harmful to stock. The latter include a few insects, chiefly species that sometimes cause the death of animals that eat them; the only one that is stated to present a serious problem and is discussed at any length is the sawfly, Platypsectra interrupta (Klug), the larvae of which poison cattle in one part of Queensland [ cf. 26 149, etc.-]. More than half the publication is devoted to an account of the introduction (probably in 3872) and spread of the cattle tick, Boophilus annulat us micro-plus (Can.) ( D. a. australis (Fuller)), which is established in the north of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, in the north and east of Queensland and in the north-eastern tip of New South Wales, and the measures that have been taken to control it in various States and to eradicate it from New South Wales [ cf. 16 193].

AB  - Earlier work from our laboratory indicated that injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into non-vitellogenic female Amblyomma hebraeum ticks stimulates the synthesis of vitellogenin (Vg), but not its uptake into oocytes [Friesen, K., Kaufman, W.R., 2004. Effects of 20-hydroxyecdysone and other hormones on egg development, and identification of a vitellin-binding protein in the ovary of the tick, Amblyomma hebraeum. Journal of Insect Physiology 50, 519-529]. In contrast, Thompson et al. [Thompson, D.M., Khalil, S.M.S., Jeffers, L.A., Ananthapadmanaban, U., Sonenshine, D.E., Mitchell, R.D., Osgood, C.J., Apperson, C.S., Roe, M.R., 2005. In vivo role of 20-hydroxyecdysone in the regulation of the vitellogenin mRNA and egg development in the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say). Journal of Insect Physiology 51, 1105-1116] demonstrated that injection of 20E into virgin female Dermacentor variabilis ticks stimulated both vitellogenesis and Vg uptake into oocytes. In addition to the species difference in the two studies there were substantially different methods for injecting 20E. In our earlier work we injected small partially fed ticks after removing them from the host. Thompson et al. injected the females while they remained attached to the host. So in this study we repeated our earlier experiments on A. hebraeum using on-host injection. We also injected 20E into off-host ticks with or without haemolymph collected from engorged ticks (days 2-10 post-engorgement), or from large partially fed mated ticks in the rapid phase of engorgement, to see whether we might detect a 'vitellogenin uptake factor' (VUF) in haemolymph. Off-host injection of 20E (0.45 g/g body weight (bw)) did not induce ovary development beyond that of vehicle-injected controls. But ticks in this study, receiving 20E plus haemolymph from engorged ticks, showed a significant increase in ovary weight beyond that of 20E alone (1.310.05% bw; 34 for 20E plus haemolymph and 1.030.05% bw; 25 for 20E alone). However, in normal engorged A. hebraeum, the ovary exceeds 7% bw at the onset of oviposition. As in our earlier work, in this study 20E stimulated Vg-synthesis (3.90.5 mg Vt-equivalents/ml) beyond that occurring in vehicle-injected ticks (0.760.14 mg Vt-equivalents/ml), and there was a further increase in ticks injected with 20E plus haemolymph from engorged ticks (8.91.0 mg Vt-equivalents/ml). On-host injection of 20E alone (6 g 20E/g bw) did not produce a statistically significant increase in oocyte length over that of vehicle-injected controls, whereas on-host injection of 20E plus engorged haemolymph resulted in significantly larger oocytes (26157 m) compared to vehicle-injected controls (13211 m), compared to 20E alone (13112 m), or haemolymph alone (12424 m). There was a marked stimulation of Vg-synthesis by 31 g 20E/g bw (6.01.5 mg Vt-equivalents/ml) compared to vehicle-injected controls (1.0233 mg Vt-equivalents/ml). Vt accumulation by ovaries was significantly greater in ticks treated with haemolymph (123 g Vt/mg ovary) or 20E plus haemolymph (5626 g Vt/mg ovary) compared to vehicle-injected controls (5.11.5 g Vt/mg ovary). There was also a significant effect of 6 g 20E/g bw plus engorged haemolymph on ovary weight (1.740.29% bw) compared to vehicle-injected ticks (0.950.10% bw), but not compared to ticks injected with 20E alone (1.250.19% bw). We conclude that at least some of the differences observed between the two laboratories relate to the species difference, and that there is some evidence that the engorged haemolymph of A. hebraeum contains a VUF.

AB  - Objective.- The purpose of this study was to determine whether 400 μg/kg oral ivermectin is able to kill Ixodes scapularis nymphs and adult female ticks feeding on humans. Methods.- Ten study subjects each wore 2 ostomy bags, the one containing 24 I scapularis nymphs, and the other containing 24 I scapularis adult females. Twenty-four hours after the ostomy bags were attached, study subjects received either 400 μg/kg ivermectin or placebo. Thirty hours after the ivermectin or placebo was consumed, the ticks were removed, and mortality determined in a double-blinded manner. Results.- Eleven percent of the I scapularis nymphs attached in the ivermectin group compared with 17% in the placebo. Mortality for the I scapularis nymphs that attached at the time of removal was 55% in the ivermectin group and 47% in the placebo group. Mortality for the I scapularis nymphs 5 days after removal was 92% in the ivermectin group and 88% for the placebo. Three percent of the I scapularis adults attached in the ivermectin group compared with 9% in the placebo group. Mortality for I scapularis adults was 0% on day 3 and 33% on day 8 for both the ivermectin and placebo groups. There were statistically insignificant differences in the mortality rates between I scapularis nymphs and adults exposed to ivermectin or placebo. Conclusions.- There were a high number of ticks that died in both groups but the data do not support our hypothesis that ivermectin can kill I scapularis. The study was not designed to determine whether it could prevent the transmission of tick-borne illness. © 2014 Wilderness Medical Society.

AB  - Background. Although most tick bites in humans in areas of the northeastern United States in which Lyme disease is highly endemic are due to Ixodes dammini, no study documents the frequency of I. dammini bites in low-prevalence or emerging areas for Lyme disease. Data on the proportion of tick bites in humans that are due to I. dammini in a region may have implications for public health policy and clinical management. Methods. A statewide survey of the tick species that parasitized humans in Maine was conducted during 1989 and 1990. Tick submissions from throughout the state were elicited through media announcements. All ticks that had been removed from humans were identified, and data were collected that included bite seasonality and geography and demographics of tick bite victims. Results. Of 709 ticks submitted, only 17% were I. dammini. Ixodes cookei, a vector for Powassan encephalitis, accounted for 34% of bites, and Dermacentor variabilis accounted for 45%. Other tick species were occasionally implicated. Conclusions. The likelihood that a tick bite was due to I. dammini was lower in Maine than in areas in the northeastern United States in which Lyme disease is highly endemic. Other tick vectors, associated with diseases other than Lyme disease, were more frequently implicated. Regional tick bite surveys may prove useful in assessing the risk of Lyme disease following a tick bite.

AB  - Background: Sand flies are the only biologically adapted vectors of Leishmania parasites, however, a possible role in the transmission of Leishmania has been proposed for other hematophagous ectoparasites such as ticks. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania infantum in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, taking into account its close association with dogs, 128 adult R. sanguineus ticks removed from 41 dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis were studied. Methods: Individual DNA extraction was performed from each tick and whole blood taken from dogs. Dog sera were tested for IgG antibodies to L. infantum antigen by ELISA and L. infantum real-time PCR was performed from canine whole blood samples and ticks. Results: Leishmania infantum PCR was positive in 13 ticks (10.1%) including one female, (2.0%) and 12 males (15.2%), and in only five dogs (12.2%). Male ticks had a significantly higher infection rate when compared to female R. sanguineus. The percentage of L. infantum seroreactive dogs was 19.5%. All but two PCR positive dogs were seroreactive. Leishmania infantum PCR positive ticks were removed from seropositive and seronegative dogs with a variety of PCR results. Conclusions: This study demonstrates high prevalence of L. infantum DNA in R. sanguineus ticks removed from L. infantum seropositive and seronegative dogs. The presence of L. infantum DNA was detected mainly in male ticks possibly due to their ability to move between canine hosts and feed on several canine hosts during the adult life stage. Additional studies are needed to further explore the role of R. sanguineus ticks and in particular, male adults, in both the epidemiology and immunology of L. infantum infection in dogs in endemic areas.

AB  - Background: Sand flies are the only biologically adapted vectors of Leishmania parasites, however, a possible role in the transmission of Leishmania has been proposed for other hematophagous ectoparasites such as ticks. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania infantum in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, taking into account its close association with dogs, 128 adult R. sanguineus ticks removed from 41 dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis were studied. Methods. Individual DNA extraction was performed from each tick and whole blood taken from dogs. Dog sera were tested for IgG antibodies to L. infantum antigen by ELISA and L. infantum real-time PCR was performed from canine whole blood samples and ticks. Results: Leishmania infantum PCR was positive in 13 ticks (10.1%) including one female, (2.0%) and 12 males (15.2%), and in only five dogs (12.2%). Male ticks had a significantly higher infection rate when compared to female R. sanguineus. The percentage of L. infantum seroreactive dogs was 19.5%. All but two PCR positive dogs were seroreactive. Leishmania infantum PCR positive ticks were removed from seropositive and seronegative dogs with a variety of PCR results. Conclusions: This study demonstrates high prevalence of L. infantum DNA in R. sanguineus ticks removed from L. infantum seropositive and seronegative dogs. The presence of L. infantum DNA was detected mainly in male ticks possibly due to their ability to move between canine hosts and feed on several canine hosts during the adult life stage. Additional studies are needed to further explore the role of R. sanguineus ticks and in particular, male adults, in both the epidemiology and immunology of L. infantum infection in dogs in endemic areas. © 2012 Solano-Gallego et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The prevalence of E. chaffeensis, spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae and Borrelia spp. was determined in ticks that had been collected in June-July 1992 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, USA, using 2 methods: attached ticks were removed from rodents collected in Sherman box traps or Mohawk small mammal traps baited with peanut butter mixed with bird seed and a slice of apple, and after releasing the rodent at capture sites, 4 dry ice-baited tick traps (containing 2.7 kg of solid CO 2 each) were placed equidistant on the circumference of a 7-m diameter circle centred on each mammal trap site and captured ticks were removed 24 h later. Of 159 tick midgut samples examined using direct fluorescent assays, 5 (3 Amblyomma americanum and 2 Dermacentor variabilis) were positive for SFG rickettsiae (using antibodies against Rickettsia rickettsii) and 8 (7 A. americanum and 1 D. variabilis) for Borrelia spp. (using antibodies against B. burgdorferi). Sera from 1 Peromyscus leucopus, 3 Mus musculus and 25 Sigmodon hispidus were negative for antibodies to E. chaffeensis. Dry ice-baited tick traps caught significantly more Ixodes scapularis ( n = 3), A. americanum ( n = 146) and D. variabilis ( n = 9) (combined total of 158 ticks) compared to collections from rodent hosts (total of 1 tick).

AB  - Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative bacterial agent of Lyme borreliosis, a tick-transmitted infectious disease. The Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement (CBO) has now issued a guideline on 'Lyme borreliosis'. Lyme borreliosis is classified as 'early', 'early disseminated', 'late' or as 'post-infectious complaints and symptoms'. Erythema migrans is the most common manifestation of early Lyme borreliosis. Frequent neurological manifestations of 'early disseminated Lyme borreliosis' include meningoradiculitis, meningitis and peripheral facial palsy, but Lyme carditis and arthritis also occur. Late Lyme borreliosis is characterised by skin abnormalities (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), chronic neuroborreliosis or chronic arthritis. Confirmation serology with respect to Borrelia is the most commonly used laboratory technique, but in early Lyme borreliosis the immune response may be absent. In addition, the mere presence of antibodies in the serum is no proof of an active infection with Borrelia and serology may yield false-positive reactions. Doxycycline and ceftriaxone are the most commonly used antibiotics in the various stages of Lyme borreliosis. Lyme borreliosis may be prevented by avoiding high-risk areas, keeping the skin covered as much as possible, and inspection of the skin after possible exposure to remove ticks within 24 hours. Laboratory tests after a tick bite are not recommended, nor is prophylactic treatment with antibiotics.

AB  - A variety of methods have been developed to prevent human infection by the Lyme disease spirochete in the northeastern United States, mainly based on the observations that nymphal Ixodes dammini serve as vector, that deer serve as hosts for the reproductive stage of this tick, that white-footed mice serve as the reservoir of infection, and that nymphs are most abundant in early-summer and must attach for 2 days before infection is transmitted. Methods for personal protection included seasonal avoidance of infested sites, the use of repellants, and prompt removal of attached ticks. Destruction of mouse habitat, but not of mice, was locally effective. Nondestructive acaricidal treatment of deer proved ineffective, but the elimination of these hosts resulted in reduced transmission after several years. Treatment of mice by means of acaricide-impregnated bedding material effectively reduced transmission.

AB  - The main object of this paper, published as it is in an agricultural journal, is to impress upon farmers the extreme importance of dipping, but it is valuable apart from this in that it summarizes our existing knowledge of the disease. Heartwater is defined as a specific febrile disease affecting sheep, goats and cattle in South Africa, due to an ultravisible virus transmitted by the bont tick Amblyomma hebraeum. It derives its name from the most prominent lesion, namely, effusion of plasma into the pericardium and chest cavity. The disease is transmissible by inoculation with blood, spleen pulp, effusions, and milk from a freshly dead animal. The blood remains infective for a short time only after the temperature has become normal, but animals may become affected a second time. It has been shown that a single tick is sufficient to transmit he disease. Prior to the introduction of dipping, heartwater rendered sheep and goat farming impossible in the lower lying areas, and it is still a scourge in low veldt districts in the Transvaal. While small stock generally are susceptible to infection, the susceptibility varies with different breeds. The Angora goat is the greatest victim, then the Boer goat, Merino sheep and its crosses, and the Afrikander. Persian sheep generally escape with a febrile attack only. Cattle are less susceptible than sheep. The springbok is known to be affected occasionally. Horses are insusceptible. Transmission naturally is by the tick. The infection does not pass through the egg. but a tick picking up the infection in one stage transmits it in the next. If the next stage is passed on an insusceptible animal the tick does not thereby lose its infectivity. Amblyomma hebraeum is the principal infecting tick, but A. vanegatum is also capable of transmitting the disease. The life-cycle of A. hebraeum is as follows: Egg-laying begins in 2-12 weeks after engorgement, and lasts for 3-9 weeks. Hatching takes place in 4-6 months on an average, but the period may be shorter or longer, depending upon the temperature. Time of engorgement of the larva 5-7 days. Moulting of the larva takes 1-3 months. Engorgement and moulting of the nymph require 4-8 days and 4-12 weeks respectively. In the final stage the female seeks the male after he has fed for several days, and copulation takes place while both are attached. The female remains attached for 10-20 days, while the male may remain for several weeks and probably mates again. The complete life-cycle therefore occupies a period of not less than 9 months, and may amount to two years. Further larvae, nymphs, and adults may live 7, 6, and 12 months respectively without having access to a host. The tick requires a certain degree of warmth and moisture for its maintenance, and although it is annually brought on to the high veldt it has not become established there. LOUNSBURY has shown that moulting at very low temperatures deprives them of their infectivity, but that warming them in an incubator prior to placing them on a host restores that virulence. The lesions of the disease are sometimes inconspicuous. The presence of serous fluid in the chest and pericardium is characteristic but not invariable. The fluid is in the nature of a transudate; there is no true pleurisy or pericarditis. The liquid clots quickly when it is withdrawn. There may be some peritoneal effusion, and the fourth stomach may show inflammatory changes in the mucous membrane, including tiny blood markings. The spleen is enlarged and softened. The brain and membranes are congested, and the spinal fluid in excess. In cases of natural infection the period of incubation is 11-18 days. By intravenous blood inoculation the period of incubation may be reduced to 10 and 5 days, depending upon the dose given. By subcutaneous inoculation the period may be from a fortnight to three weeks. The symptoms are most obvious in the goat, and usually the first to be observed is stiffness. If such a goat be urged to move, evidence of respiratory distress will make its appearance. Depression and cessation of rumination are observed soon after. Evidence of nervous disturbance is seen in some cases from the onset, squinting eyes, bleating, salivation and chewing movements, etc. A single fit or a. succession of them may be seen in some cases. In some cases death occurs without any premonitory symptoms being observed. In a period of some weeks after recovery from a severe attack both sheep and goats will cast their fleece. The fever reaction is peculiar. It usually rises abruptly to 105 or 106degrees, remains there for a day or two and drops just as suddenly. It may be subnormal shortly before death. In cattle the symptoms are not so pronounced, and it appears to be-, highly probable that animals reared on infected veldt acquire immunity. In small calves the symptoms resemble those seen in the goat, but are not quite so marked. Death usually occurs on the fourth day. The death-rate may sometimes be as high as 50 per cent. Medicinal treatment is of no value; isolation in the shade is the-best plan to adopt. Immunity is very difficult to produce, and even infection by ticks, is not effective, and animals have been known to have two attacks within a year. Blood retains its virulence for 48 hours or so, but not longer. It cannot be preserved by the addition of antiseptics. It is. destroyed by heat and desiccation. The bile is non-infective and non-immunizing. Hyperimmunization produces a serum capable of" conferring a very brief immunity. Double inoculation is useless. Prevention. -Change of pasture to high veldt brings about a cessation of the disease in three weeks. On low veldt two changes at intervals of three" or four weeks checks the mortality. Starving the ticks by removing susceptible animals for a period of two years is effective, but generally not practicable. The grazing of Persian sheep on infected land would not cause any mortality, but the infection would be kept alive in the ticks. Burning the grass is inefficient, as ticks in crevices in the ground escape. The only reliable method of dealing with the disease is by dipping. With a view of dealing with heartwater, sheep and goats should be dipped two or three times at intervals of ten days. But dipping to be effective must be a continuous policy of tick destruction; and to get the best results the principal host of all ticks, namely cattle, must be treated. The dipping should be practised at short intervals, as with intervals of a fortnight proper tolerance to the arsenic and proper-saturation of the skin with the drug is not achieved. The author states that in two years the worst tick infested property can be freed if the dipping be regular and thorough.

AB  - Four different forms of tick paralysis can be distinguished in South Africa according to the symptoms and the species of tick involved. The most important economically is Karoo tick paralysis, which affects sheep, goats and cattle, some species of antelope and, exceptionally, dogs. It is caused by the bite of adult females of Ixodes rubicundus Neum., which are active during the winter. Immature stages only exceptionally attach themselves to the susceptible hosts. All early references to tick paralysis in South African literature, some of which are reviewed in the present paper, refer to this type, and it was shown in 1950 that although some paralysis had previously been attributed to l. piloaus Koch [ cf. R.A.E., B 32 18, etc.], I. rubicundus alone is found in the areas from which the paralysis has been recorded [40 171]. The range of the tick has recently extended considerably into the Karoo, and the condition that it causes is spreading rapidly. Symptoms appear during the last phase of engorgement, and all limbs of the host are affected simultaneously. The rate of recovery is high if the ticks are removed but, if they are not, losses may be considerable. An unexpectedly early outbreak in 1951 resulted in mortality of up to 15 per cent. of the stock on some farms. Rhipicephalus evertsi Neum. causes spring lamb paralysis, and sporadic cases have been recorded in adult sheep and calves; it is present in most of South Africa throughout the year [40 171] and infests various other hosts, in none of which has paralysis been recorded. Outbreaks have occurred in the high veldt of the eastern Orange Free State, southwards to Sterkstroom in Cape Province and in the Belfast area of the Transvaal. Symptoms occur during engorgement. The hind legs only are affected, at least at first, regardless of the site of attachment. Recovery rate is high provided that the ticks are removed. Leg weakness in geese and ducks is caused in several parts of South Africa by Argas persicus (Oken). The condition has also been observed in fowls when larvae and adults engorge simultaneously, but adults can cause paralysis in geese and-ducks in the absence of larvae. Symptoms appear 61/2-7 days after engorgement, and only the legs are affected. The recovery rate is low. Paralysis, consisting of general weakness with undisturbed sensitivity and due to R. simus Koch, was recorded in a human adult in 1950. Chronic localized motor paralysis and complete loss of sensation in the affected area have been described in an adult, due to Hyalomma tmncatutn Koch, and reference made to their occurrence in a child, due to L rubicundus. In view of the spread of Karoo tick paralysis, intensive investigations on the habits and ecology of I. rubicundus and the conditions under which the affection occurs were begun in 1954 in the areas around New Bethesda, Cape Province, where the tick is particularly abundant and losses of sheep in recent years have been severe. Observations over three seasons showed that, under conditions of continuous grazing, adult females were present from February to October and most abundant in April and May. Larvae were found by dragging from March to August and were most numerous in May and June. Nymphs were taken on red hare ( Pronolagus rupestris saundersiae) from May to January with a peak in August and September. Observations from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. showed the adults to be active throughout this period but most so between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. ; the immature stages were found only at night. Larvae were active at temperatures as low as 3.1°C. [37.58°F.], and peak activity occurred between 12 and 13°C. [53.6 and 55.4°F.]. The chief hosts of the immature stages are P. r. saundersiae, Lepus saxatilis albaniensis and Elephantulus spp. Adults occur mainly on domestic stock, sometimes on antelopes and incidentally on other animals, but never on birds. The females attach themselves to the underside and legs of sheep, preferring the wooled parts of the body, on which higher proportions reach full engorgement. Engorgement usually took 4-7 days. It was most rapid at low temperatures and when the sheep was paralyzed, and was more rapid on bare than wooled parts of the body, of ewes. Two stages of engorgement were recognised, separated by a period of about two days during which the tick remains unchanged. Mating was observed to continue for periods of 1-9 days during attachment of the female and also to take place on the ground before attachment. Engorgement tended to be quicker when pairing began during the first three days of attachment. Observations on tick populations were made on tethered sheep and by a modification of the drag method in which small strips of material, often tubes of flannelette, rough side out, were fastened so as to trail behind a 6-ft. horizontal bar. Flannelette was the most attractive, to the immature stages, of various materials tested. Adults were strongly attracted to corduroy, but the immature stages were not. Strips of sheepskin with the wool attached and as: weighted so as to keep well down in the vegetation picked up the adults, which live at lower levels than the immature stages. Larvae were found to be very evenly distributed in the field. A survey of the distribution of I. rubicundus in relation to the different types of veldt over a limited area in the Sneeuberg range showed that the presence of the tick could be correlated with certain plant associations. It did not occur in unmixed sweet-grass mountain veldt, which constitutes the original coverage of all mountains in the area, and showed an association with deterioration of pasture resembling that noted in the case of I. ricinus (L.) in Britain [32 232; 37 193; 39 46]. Tick paralysis was found in all poor veldt types providing little palatable food and in good pasture from which poor land had to be crossed to reach water. The tick was most susceptible to unsuitable environmental conditions in the larval stage, and eggs failed to hatch if grass was too short to offer good shelter or if moisture was deficient; all stages were killed by direct sunlight. Larval surveys in localities exposed to natural infestation showed that sweet-grass mountain veldt can support the tick if it is invaded by Rhus erosa. Tick densities were always significantly higher in veldt types with R. erosa than in the corresponding type without it. Existing plant associations can be altered, and in certain cases this can be done within a few years, but R. erosa does not disappear during reclamation by good grass management, although it can be controlled with weed-killers. Veldt fires can cause much improvement if correctly managed but cause considerable deterioration if the burnt veldt is restocked too soon. Regular dipping reduces numbers of I. rubicundus, but there are no records of eradication of the tick by this means. Exclusion of sheep from infested areas during the season of tick activity has no effect on incidence. Dips containing several toxicants were compared in the laboratory by shaking ten ticks for one minute in a 1 x 11/2 in. specimen tube with about 2-5 cc. wash, transferring them to filter paper in a petri dish and observing their condition after 24 and 48 hours. The results for each batch were recorded as a figure obtained by adding together the number affected but capable of slight movement, the number incapable of forward movement but alive multiplied by 3, and the number dead multiplied by 5, omitting the number not affected. It appeared that gamma BHC was at least four times as toxic as dieldrin. The ability of a toxicant to diffuse along the wool fibres appeared to be important for protection against I. rubicundus, as it is against blowfly strike [44 89]. BHC protected sheep carrying six months' wool for more than 18 weeks when 4.75 g. gamma isomer was deposited per sheep from a walk-through bath 18 in. deep, and dieldrin for about 11 weeks with a deposit of 7 g. active ingredient. It is estimated from the curves of protection that 1.65 g. gamma BHC is equal in effectiveness to 7 g. dieldrin. This confirms the laboratory estimate. If immediate kill is important, the bath should be filled to a depth of 22 in. Immersion of the heads is essential. A field experiment with BHC against Hyalomma spp. and Rhipicephalus evertsi, which attach themselves to the bare parts of the sheep possibly without crawling through the wool, showed that high but not complete protection was achieved. No decrease in effectiveness was seen in four weeks. An emulsion with a high depletion rate gave a greater BHC deposit, and so better protection, than one with a lower rate. For the control of J. rubicundus and prevention of tick paralysis, improvement of pasture quality, aimed at complete reclamation to sweet-grass veldt, combined with foot-dipping with gamma BHC or dieldrin, is recommended.

AB  - In South Africa a motor paralysis affecting particularly the limbs and caused by the tick rubicundus is a serious disease of sheep and cattle. Animals recover within a few hours when all ticks are removed. Not all I. rubicundus ticks are able to cause paralysis. It occurs regularly in certain tick-infested paddocks, and never in others. Two types of immunity have been demonstrated, one against the toxic agent and lasting for not more than 5 weeks, and the other against the tick. Paralysis has never been seen in tethered sheep, despite heavy tick infestation. The life cycle of the tick, which is completed in 2 years, is described. Tick populations are determined by dragging across the pasture a light wooden bar, 6 feet long, behind which trail 12 tubes, 2 inches in diameter and 18 inches long, made of flannelette. The disease is controlled by dipping. Burning of pasture is another possible method of control.-M.G.G.

AB  - The large number of cases reported in man and the striking symptomatology and uniformity of the clinical picture of these cases leaves little doubt that such a disease exists. Although there are constant differences between American and Australian cases, in general they are similar. The paucity of information about blood or spinal fluid findings or the pathological changes involved in these cases accounts for there being no laboratory diagnostic method. Diagnosis must be made on the basis of circumstance and the clinical findings. Errors in diagnosis have been made frequently, but this is not to be unexpected. Neurological signs are regularly encountered in tick-borne Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Just why there should be differences between the American and Australian cases is not apparent. The striking difference is in the duration of the disease after the offending tick has been removed. In a few clinical reports symptoms persist to such a degree as to suggest that these cases might be bacterial or viral in nature. There is also little doubt about the existence of a disease of domestic animals which resembles closely the pattern of the disease in man. Again, satisfactory means for objective diagnosis are lacking, and in many of the reported cases and epidemics it seems certain that an infectious disease was involved. In contrast to the complexity of the aetiology of tick paralysis is the simplicity of treatment. For the most part, either in man or in animals, this resolves itself into the removal of the tick. In human cases if bulbar signs are present more vigourous supportive measures, including the use of the Drinker respirator, may be resorted to. Hamilton's anti-tick dog serum has been given insufficient clinical trial to warrant critical opinion at the present time. The cause of tick paralysis remains obscure. It is improbable that a specific bacterial, viral, orrickettsial agent is responsible, for transmission experiments using blood and macerated organs of ill animals have been uniformly unsuccessful, and, further, the remarkable subsidence of signs and symptoms following removal of the tick seems incompatible with an established parasite within the host. The features of the disease are most readily explained by hypothecating a toxic agent formed in the tick and injected into the host. This toxin might be formed within the tick ova and diffused into the salivary glands, it might be formed within the salivary glands, or it might be formed elsewhere and activated by the salivary glands. The origin and nature of this toxin remain undisclosed despite the large amount of experimental work which has been done. The most convincing experiments are those which demonstrate a toxic agent within the egg. Eaton noted the similarity of tick paralysis to coniine poisoning. He thought that the alkaline saliva might combine with tissue fatty acids, thereby displacing glycerin which could be acted on by any one of several saprophytic organisms with formation of butyric acid. Butyric acid in turn might combine with ammonia to form coniine. It is difficult to see how this necessarily complex synthesis could take place. Woltmann in a discussion of Abbott's review also noted the similarity of tick paralysis to coniine poisoning. Since in tick paralysis peripheral neuromuscular function is intact it would seem unlikely that coniines or similar alkaloids could be involved. These act on myoneural junctions as well as on synapses. McKay considered the mechanism of action of the toxin to be that of an antigen (sic) which increases the permeability of local blood vessels, with exudation of serum and pressure on the nerves. He thought the poison had a selective action also for the vagus centre. There seems to be little support for this highly speculative point of view.

AB  - The disposable ring curette (Curette Stiefel) has become an essential part of our dermatosurgical equipment for the removal of benign skin lesions, especially seborrhoeic keratoses and various virus-acanthomas, for the debridement of wounds, including ulcers and burns, for the removal of tick parts, for the excision of ingrowing toe nails and for the treatment of actinic keratosis. With experience and skill in handling the ring curette, it is possible to obtain good representative specimens for histological examination of the lesion and possible tumour infiltration. In the case of malignant lesions, whenever possible, histologically controlled excision is the treatment of choice in preference to curettage. Curettage is a useful treatment for precancerous lesions and superficial basal cell carcinomas, and for elderly patients with multiple, small and well-defined basal cell carcinomas in low-risk anatomic sites. Use of the ring curette alone, with good technique, appropriate indications, suitable patients and good wound management, minimises complications and gives a good clinical and cosmetic result.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate three commercially available tick removal tools against medium-tipped nontissue tweezers. Methods. We evaluated three commercially available tick removal tools against medium-tipped tweezers. Three inexperienced users randomly removed attached American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say) and lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum L.) from laboratory rabbits in a university animal facility using all tools during one removal session. Results. Tick damage occurring from removal and quantity of attachment cement were compared. No tool removed nymphs without damage and all tools removed adults of both species successfully. American dog ticks proved easier to remove than lone star ticks, whose mouthparts often remained in the skin. Conclusions. Nymphal ticks were consistently removed more successfully with commercial tools when compared with tweezers but with more difficulty than adults were removed. The commercial tick removal tools tested are functional for removal of nymphs and adults and should be considered as viable alternatives to medium-tipped tweezers.

AB  - Ticks are blood-sucking parasites of vertebrates that may embed in human skin and are therefore of clinical relevance to dermatologists and their medical colleagues. Depending on the species involved, consequences of tick attachment vary from minor local reactions to significant systemic sequelae. It is possible to minimize morbidity by removing the tick in its entirety as soon as it is detected. Some techniques to achieve this are described. This review will aid clinicians in the recognition and practical management of tick bites in Australia. [References: 33]

AB  - Traditionally, the classification of risk areas of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is based on the recording of autochthonous cases of the disease. In Germany, an extension of these areas over the years and an increasing virus prevalence in ticks have been observed in recent years. Registration of foci with autochthonous TBE cases, recording of disease incidence and virus prevalence in ticks are all proven epidemiological methods to characterize TBE risk areas. These data are necessary for a scientifically proven recommendation of TBE vaccines, and they need to be updated regularly. These epidemiological methods have advantages and disadvantages with respect to the risk assessment of TBE areas. Despite the fact that these methods are suitable for risk assessment in practice, disease incidence (new cases per year/100 000 inhabitants) and virus prevalence in questing ticks did not correlate. Using nested RT-PCR we were able to demonstrate that the prevalence of TBE virus (TBEV) in ticks removed from humans was significantly higher than in unfed, free-living Ixodes ricinus of the same area. The 561 ticks collected from humans in doctors' surgeries in Bavaria in 2002 were examined by nRT-PCR. The estimated overall virus prevalence in tested ticks was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.45-11.57%). The removed ticks examined were classified according to the sites of exposure of the patients in the individual districts. Peak values were measured in the district of Regen with 20.6% and in the district of Freyung-Grafenau with 18.3%. In recent studies on unfed I. ricinus (nymphs, adults), the average TBEV prevalence in ticks in Bavarian risk areas was between 0.5% and 2%.

AB  - During the last decade, much research on control strategies against the primary vector, Ixodes scapularis, of Lyme disease in northeastern USA has been carried out. This has included work on biological or chemical control, habitat modification, and reduction of host availability. In this paper we evaluate the possibility of using these methods for control of the primary vector of Lyme borreliosis in Sweden, I. ricinus. It is emphasized that in Sweden people mainly contract Lyme borreliosis in woodlands and forests. Because of the enormous size of the area that would need treatment, general application of acaricides and habitat modification may not work well in Sweden. Another possible method is to reduce the availability of tick hosts. This method can be targeted at species that are essential for tick reproduction or at hosts that are capable of infecting ticks with Borrelia burgdorferi. On isolated Swedish islands where few mammal species are present, reduction of the main or only reservoir host may effectively control Lyme borreliosis. On the Swedish mainland, however, at least four common mammal species are important blood-hosts to female I. ricinus, and at least eight common mammal species are competent reservoirs for B. burgdorferi. Sufficient reduction of host availability may therefore not be achieved here without killing vast numbers of mammals. In general in Sweden, the most effective method of preventing Lyme borreliosis seems to be to inform people about how to dress in risk areas, and that daily checks for ticks with prompt removal of attached ticks drastically reduces the infection risk.

AB  - Piroplasmosis in cattle in Norway is of strictly limited geographical extent, occurring in a narrow zone ail round the coast but not extending to the northernmost stretches. Its incidence naturally varies from year to year and averages somewhat over 1, 000 cases, according to the official livestock disease returns. The author has attempted to calculate, by means of a mathematical formula, the true complete incidence, i.e. supposing that every case could be notified, for every territorial unit or district. Non-piroplasmic haemo globinuria also occurs alongside piroplasmosis, but on the whole is less prevalent. The districts most severely affected with piroplasmosis are More and Romsdal (south of Trondheim) and West Agder (in the extreme south). Although clinical cases occasionally occur in winter, the disease is essentially a summer one by reason of its vector, Ixodes ricinus; indeed the extent of piroplasmosis is merely an indication of the tick population at any particular time, and this is governed chiefly by climatic conditions, ticks and piroplasmosis being more prevalent in wet and warm summers. The double annual peak of prevalence of I. ricinus noted in Scotland by MAcLEOD, with a high peak in early summer and a low secondary peak in autumn, these being dependent on climatic conditions favouring tick activity, are stated hardly to occur in Norway. Observations are reported on this point comprising tick counts on three cows during the period June-October, which show a high peak in the second week in June, shortly after the cattle are turned out to summer pasture, then a steady decline to early August, then a very small peak followed by continuation of the decline. The systematics of Babesia bovis is discussed and it is concluded that only a single type or strain is involved. Detailed data on specimens of I. ricinus obtained in Norway are set out. Adults were recovered from man, cattle, the horse, sheep, goat, dog, and cat; nymphs from cattle, the horse, sheep, goat, squirrel, jay, blackbird, song thrush, and eagle owl; and larvae from cattle, , the squirrel, shrew, and blackbird. Copulating pairs were observed on cattle and sheep and it was noticed that ungorged as well as gorged females could copulate. Both light and dark specimens were seen, but all were considered to be of a single species or type. Ticks were found at heights up to 500 metres above sea level. Several photographs show representative tick terrain consisting of hillside grass plots merging into thicket with more or less bracken. Ticks were to be found in thicket where the micro-climate was relatively stable/and humid, in accordance with known facts about the life conditions of this tick. In this connexion, MAcLEOD's observations are discussed at length. It is stated that the control of ticks and of piroplasmosis is not essentially difficult, consisting of the clearance and fencing of pasture, and the dipping of affected farm animals or removal of the ticks by other means, together with medicinal treatment. It was shown that the repeated removal of ticks from cattle on a particular pasture, all through one grazing season, greatly reduced the tick incidence during the following years.- J. E.

AB  - The emergence of Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI) questions the validity of reported Lyme disease (LD) cases throughout the southern United States. Acute symptoms are identical, and an efficient method of diagnosis is currently unavailable, with the cause(s) in question. The etiologic agent of LD, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis (Black-legged Tick), while Amblyomma americanum (Lone Star Tick) is known to carry B. lonestari, the bacterium associated with cases of STARI. Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse) is a very efficient reservoir for these bacteria and tolerant of their vectors. We sampled small (<3 ha) and large (>3 ha) forest patches in Virginia for tick densities, burdens, and infestation rates by collecting ticks by drag sampling and from mice. We also tested ticks for infection by Borrelia. Although mouse density was greater in small patches, tick densities, burdens, and infestation rates did not differ with patch size. B. burgdorferi was not detected in any tick species, but 3.4% of nymphal and 5.9% of adult Lone Star Ticks removed from vegetation were infected with B. lonestari.

AB  - Lyme disease is a relatively new clinical entity caused by the spirochaete Borrelij burgdorferi. It is transmitted by a variety of tick vectors, depending on the geographical location, with Ixodes ricinus being the most common vector in the UK. Only five to 10 per cent of dogs exposed to Borrelia develop clinical signs, which classically present as fever - with associated lethargy - followed by shifting limb lameness. These signs are not pathognomonic, and PCR-based tests to document the presence of the Borrelia spirochaetes are needed to confirm borreliosis. Serology documents exposure to Borrelia and a high or rising antibody level can support the diagnosis. Treatment with doxycycline leads to resolution of clinical signs in most cases. However, chronic non-erosive polyarthritis and glomerular nephritis are seen in chronic infections. The aetiology of these signs is not fully understood, but are most likely due to the ability of Borrelia to evade the immune system and the chronic inflammatory response this evokes. Prevention is based on preventive acaricide treatments and prompt tick removal.

AB  - Aim: Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus causes a severe disease in humans with a mortality up to 30 %. In Turkey there has been an increase in the number of cases during years since 2002. Children working as shepherds and toddlers as well as adults living in endemic areas are in the high risk group. Materials and Methods: 409 children from the city of Ankara and surrounding regions who were investigated at Ankara Dιşkapι Children's Hospital with a history of tick bite were included in the study. All the patients were followed up for 10 days and clinical and laboratory features were recorded. Results: There was a 32% increase in the number of patients presenting with a tick bite as compared to 2007. The mean age of the cases was 6.7±3.5 years (range 1-16 years) of which 52.3% was male. The ticks were identified and removed in 179 patients. Eighty six (%57.3) of the ticks belonged to the genus Hyalomma, 10 (%11.6) which belonged to the family Hyalomma marginatum marginatum. 7% (29/409) of the patients developed CCHF specific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, diarrhea and myalgia in the follow-up period, and 12 of them (2.9%) were hospitalized with a suspicion of CCHF. Of the hospitalized patients, 3 cases were confirmed as having CCHF by serology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These patients were all living in rural areas of Ankara (Kalecik, Kιzιlcahamam, Cubuk) and their parents were employed in animal husbandry or farming. Their outcome was excellent and no death occurred. Conclusion: Children who work as shepherds, toddlers and adults living in endemic areas are the most affected group. Therefore it is essential to take preventive measures for children living in rural areas as well as in endemic regions. The parents of children presenting with tick bite should be informed about CCHF in detail and the patients should be followed for at least 10 days.

AB  - The authors describe a disease of moose in northern Minnesota characterized by weakness, anaemia, paralysis, excessive blind activity and death. It occurs only during the late winter and early spring (usually between February and May); at this time many moose are infested with the tick, Dermacentor albipictus, Pack., and in some cases are almost devoid of hair as a result of severe infestation. Experiments are described in which the symptoms have been reproduced in guineapigs and rabbits infested with ticks taken from diseased moose, thus demonstrating that the disease is transmitted by the tick. A total of 75 per cent. of the experimental animals upon which adults of both sexes engorged for more than two days died, but animals that removed the ticks within 24 hours did not contract the disease. An organism has been isolated from female ticks engorged on an infected moose, which, on intravenous injection into guineapigs and rabbits, produced all the symptoms of the disease. A brief summary of the life-history of the tick is given [ cf. R.A.E., B, i, 161]. In a piece of moose hide with a heavy tick infestation, the authors found engorged females ovipositing in the tangled hair about to be shed. If this be a normal method of procedure, it is a very efficient method of tick dissemination, for the host, wandering through the brushwood, will leave the eggs widely scattered over the country.

AB  - Q fever is a vaccine-preventable disease; despite this, high annual notification numbers are still recorded in Australia. We have previously shown seroprevalence in Queensland metropolitan regions is approaching that of rural areas. This study investigated the presence of nucleic acid from Coxiella burnetii, the agent responsible for Q fever, in a number of animal and environmental samples collected throughout Queensland, to identify potential sources of human infection. Samples were collected from 129 geographical locations and included urine, faeces and whole blood from 22 different animal species; 45 ticks were removed from two species, canines and possums; 151 soil samples; 72 atmospheric dust samples collected from two locations and 50 dust swabs collected from domestic vacuum cleaners. PCR testing was performed targeting the IS1111 and COM1 genes for the specific detection of C. burnetii DNA. There were 85 detections from 1318 animal samples, giving a detection rate for each sample type ranging from 2.1 to 6.8%. Equine samples produced a detection rate of 11.9%, whilst feline and canine samples showed detection rates of 7.8% and 5.2%, respectively. Native animals had varying detection rates: pooled urines from flying foxes had 7.8%, whilst koalas had 5.1%, and 6.7% of ticks screened were positive. The soil and dust samples showed the presence of C. burnetii DNA ranging from 2.0 to 6.9%, respectively. These data show that specimens from a variety of animal species and the general environment provide a number of potential sources for C. burnetii infections of humans living in Queensland. These previously unrecognized sources may account for the high seroprevalence rates seen in putative low-risk communities, including Q fever patients with no direct animal contact and those subjects living in a low-risk urban environment.

AB  - LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Assessing laboratory parameters judiciously in a patient with no clinical features suggestive of tuberculosis LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Recognizing recent spate of false-positive TB cases in the Mid-West due to laboratory contamination CASE: 72 yo Caucasian man with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity and permanent atrial fibrillation on chronic anticoagulation presented with acute altered mental status (AMS) of 3 days duration associated with low grade fevers, inappropriate speech and disorientation. No history of recent travel/incarceration/illicit drugs. However, he did report a recent tick removal from his beard. Examination was remarkable for a combative patient in AMS with stable vitals and temperature of 103 F. Systemic and neurological examinations were otherwise unremarkable. Peripheral blood count showed leukocytosis with left shift. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless with 12/ cu.mm erythrocytes, 16/uL leucocytes (52 % neutrophils, 37 % lymphocytes), glucose 99 mg/dl and protein 65 mg/dl. CSF gram stain, Acid fast bacilli (AFB) stain and cultures were negative. Chest, cardiac and cerebral imaging was unremarkable. Extensive infectious workup for bacterial and viral etiologies of AMS was negative. Patient was empirically started on Ceftriaxone & Doxycycline for tick-borne infection. Mental status returned to baseline in 3-4 days after treatment. One month later, patient's CSFAFB culture and TB-genoprobe become positive. Patient was completely asymptomatic with normal lab parameters. Repeat CSF was colorless with 10/cu.mm erythrocytes, 2/uL leucocytes (98 % lymphocytes), glucose 75 mg/dl and protein 44 mg/dl. Serum serology was positive for Rickettsia typhi antibodies-IgG 1:256, IgM 1:64 which may explain the finding a month prior. The patient's overall clinical picture remained inconsistent with TB meningitis 1 month later. We hypothesized that this was a falsepositive culture due to laboratory contamination and did not advocate treatment for TB at this point in time. DISCUSSION: EPTB gold-standard for diagnosis involves direct smear and culture identification which has the limitations of non-rapid diagnosis, poor sensitivity and long incubation period (4-8 weeks). Recent molecularbased methods include Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays that target hup-B gene with a 90.32 % sensitivity and 94.48 % specificity. As defined by CDC, a false-positive TB testing has the following criteria: (a) if all 3 genotyping methods show a match with the presumed source of the falsepositive culture; (b) suspect isolates were processed at the same time or collected in the same location or with the same instrument; (c) no other likely explanation for findings and (d) misdiagnosed patient does not have a clinical picture consistent with TB. These parameters were true in our patient, thus validating the superiority of the clinical picture over laboratory findings and preventing our patient from being exposed to unnecessary medications. Currently, two other similar cases have been reported from the same diagnostic microbiology lab. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that all three TB isolates had the same genotype, thus validating our hypothesis of laboratory contamination.

AB  - Purpose of Study: In comparison to most of Montana, Stillwater County's climate is mild and relatively moist. This unique climate, combined with the county's location along the Yellowstone and Stillwater Rivers sets the stage for an environment rich in plant life that hosts ticks not endemic to the majority of Montana. Many outdoorsman, including kids, are exposed to ticks on an almost daily basis as their activities lead them through the underbrush that surrounds the rivers. Although actual tick-borne illness incidence is low in Montana, physicians report encountering erythema migrans in the population and several cases of relapsing fever have been documented. By educating young leaders of the outdoors, the local Boy Scout troop, on the risks associated with tick bites and tick-borne infections, this project aims to create a more tick-savvy culture among the youth and limit the incidence of tick bites and associated complications. Methods Used: The Scouts were taught a set of risk-limiting steps as published by the Infectious Disease Society of America. This was accomplished through an interactive workshop addressing each step individually. The steps corresponded to specific problems at different stages along the exposure timeline, beginning with pre-exposure preparedness and continuing through bite-wound complications such as infection. The steps were taught in chronological order: identification of problem habitats, avoidance, prevention/ protection, self-examination, removal, and red flags of infection. Summary of Results: As part of the presentation, students learned a handson method of correct tick removal technique, became proficient at identifying the duration of tick attachment, and came to understand the importance of prompt removal in minimizing the transmission of tick-borne disease. Conclusions: One of the main goals in choosing a Boy Scout audience for this project was to help disseminate information on tick awareness throughout the community. To conclude the session, the Boy Scouts were reminded of their role as leaders in their peer groups and their call to educate their peers in the knowledge they find so integral to outdoor activities. The long-term outcome of this project could take years to develop, but the desired result is a more tick-conscious youth in Columbus, who understand the risks ticks impose and are better able to minimize the risk of infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: After 2002 more and more Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) cases have been reported and it has become a major public health problem in Turkey. In order to fight CCHF, it is important to inform the public and direct them towards appropriatet attitudes and behavior. Therefore assessment of the effectiveness of health education in the community is essential.
METHODS: A research was carried out for this purpose in the province of Erzurum between May 2010 and September 2010 through a survey.
RESULTS: The results depicted that the majority of participants have knowledge that CCHF transmitted by ticks and they should be removed as soon as possible from the body through safe methods. However, in terms of correct attitude and behavior, women were found to have a lower level compared with men.
CONCLUSION: The training of health workers and an increase in the efforts to make the community, especially the women, aware of this problem is ugently needed.

AB  - Up to date, information concerning the Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection in fallow deer is scant, therefore, to verify its prevalence in these ungulates serological and PCR screenings were performed on blood of 72 fallow deer hunted in a Central-Northern Italian preserve. Molecular analyses were also performed on 90 ticks removed from the animals. A. phagocytophilum infection in fallow deer was confirmed in 20 out 72 by IFA assay and in 11 out 72 by PCR. The sequence obtained revealed a complete genetic homology among the blood samples and strong degrees of homology with other European isolates. Considering the 90 ticks collected we found that 7.3% of Ixodes ricinus harboured A. phagocytophilum specific DNA. The data obtained confirmed that fallow deer can be a competent host for A. phagocytophilum and, therefore, that may represent a biological reservoir playing an important role in the epidemiological scenarios of the infection, in the geographical areas where is widespread.

AB  - Ticks belong to the parasitical mites. There are more than 1000 different species worldwide which do need blood of warm-blooded organisms for their own development. As ticks are well known to be vectors of several pathogens which could cause insidious infectious diseases, they are important in human and veterinarian medicine as well. It is not possible to control ticks in nature. Therefore the first step should be an effective prevention. In case of a bite the tick must be removed as soon as possible. Although Ixodes ricinus is more or less responsible for all health risks caused by ticks in Germany, further species like Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor marginatus and Argas reflexus must not be forgotten, as these ticks have appeared more frequently in the recent past and they can be vectors of several diseases as well. This paper describes first and foremost the biological behaviour and development of Ixodes ricinus and the medical importance of this tick in human and veterinarian medicine. [References: 10]

AB  - The transmission dynamics of vector borne diseases depend upon at least three distinct organisms and the factors affecting them: the infectious agent, the vector, and the human or animal host. This article provides an overview of the risk factors for emergence and the multiple dimensions of the control of vector borne diseases, based on worldwide data with a focus upon the European countries and the Mediterranean Basin current situation and discusses the spectrum of disciplines involved. Emerging vector borne pathogens in Europe are: Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) Virus, Rickettsiae spp, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Tick-borne encephalitis virus group, transmitted via tick-bite, Bartonella spp via body lice, Toscana virus, and Leishmania infantum via sandfly bite, West Nile virus, Sindbis virus, and Chikungunya virus being transmitted via mosquito bite. Ticks transmit Francisella tularensis as well. Ecological and Socioeconomic factors act synergistically to facilitate emergence. Vaccines are available for only a few diseases, they are not widely used, and the prospects for vaccine generation for vector borne infections are not encouraging. Integrated vector management comprises environmental management, chemical methods, and personal protective measures, the latter involving behavioral changes and chemicals. Regarding mosquitoes, the locations of larval infestation and development should be identified, treated and if possible remove away stagnant water or clean streams from vegetation. Environmental interventions can reduce or eliminate vector breeding sites via appropriate water resources handling as well as via biological controls such as bacterial larvicides and larvivorous fish that kill larvae selectively without chemical residuals in the ecosystem. Chemical methods used reasonably, such as indoor residual sprays, chemical larvicides and adulticides, reduce the vector population. The personal protective measures combine behavioral changes, and use of chemicals as mosquito repellents and insecticide treated nets. Regarding chikungunya virus, Aedes albopictus surveillance is encouraged in european level but uniform techniques have not been established as of yet. Aedes Aegypti, a competent vector for chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever viruses, has already been introduced to the Madeira Island, Portugal, and it has been speculated that it may travel to mainland Europe via the frequent flights. In CCHF endemic areas, high risk groups should be educated to take precautions against contact with ticks, blood or other tissues from infected animals using gloves, long sleeves and trousers, application of repellents on exposed skin and clothes, containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and permethrin respectively, inspection of skin and clothes for ticks and prompt tick removal, sleep in netted area, when sleeping on the ground or camping, avoid tick hosts, cats, dogs, mice, cattle, and apply acaricidals to cattle and ship. Tick borne pathogens such as Tick borne encephalitis virus group, Borellia burgdorferi, Anaplasma fagocytophilum, Ricketsiae spp, Babesia microti and B. divergens in Europe, can be prevented by avoidance of habitat and tick infested animals, by modification of the habitat, application of acaricidals to host nests and on the coats of animal hosts, prevention of tick exposure as aforementioned, and prompt tick removal. Illegal animal transportation among countries and the concomitant cross-border spread of infected ticks should be strictly banned and closely monitored with frequent inspections by the veterinary authorities. Farming areas should be clearly distinguished and strictly differentiated from residential and tourist ones, and farmers should be guided and supervised to keep farms neat so as to avoid tick proliferation. The sandfly transmitting Toscana virus in central Italy is the reservoir for the infection, as neither mammals nor birds have been recognized as potential reservoirs as of yet, highlighting the critical role of the vector in the epidemiology of the d sease. Sandfly control and avoidance of its breeding sites have been followed by decreased incidence in human leishmaniasis. Additionally, the incidence of human leishmaniasis is directly related to the number of infectious dogs, but elimination of stray dogs provided controversial effect when not accompanied by vector control, thus imposing the latter as essential element in the leishmaniasis control, and probably cheaper. Synthetic insecticides reduce the number of sandflies in confined spaces such as rooms and tents. The National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization supervise the surveillance of human populations, the assessment of animal seroprevalence and the dissemination of information at national and international level. The close collaboration and the integrated action of Public Health Sector and Veterinarian Authorities ensure the surveillance of the vector populations, examination of pooled samples of vectors for these pathogens, monitoring of seroprevalence in zoonotic foci and supervised animal transportation among countries. National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidelines and epidemiologic data to clinicians. The International Health Regulation and Early Warning and Response System are competent tools for the preparedness and response to public health events internationally. (copyright)PHARMAKON-Press.

AB  - A number of recent (post 1987) cases of babesiosis and ehrlichioses from the USA are cited, and the diagnosis and treatment of the conditions are described. Since 1991, a Babesia-like organism, provisionally termed WA 1 has been isolated from 4 splenectomized patients in California and a patient in Washington. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was first reported in 1994 in patients from Minnesota and Wisconsin and has since been identified in several states including California. The vectors for WA 1 and Ehrlichia spp. in California have yet to be identified, but they are presumed to be ticks. A number of public health measures are recommended by the authors including advice concerning clothing suitable for wearing in tick-infested areas and methods for removing attached ticks.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted by the bite of Ixodes ricinus, registered in all parts of Yugoslavia. Vectors are very active in spring and early summer and the disease has a seasonal distribution. Generally speaking, there are three defined stages of the disease, but some of them can be misdiagnosed or really absent. Serological analysis of Lyme disease is very difficult to interpret, especially in later stages, so confirmation by immunoblot assays is recommended. The aim of this study was to present some epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of Lyme disease in Vojvodina in the period from 1993-1998. Throughout this period, 1.659 persons with tick bite were registered, whereas 560 with diagnosed Lyme disease have been treated at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Novi Sad.
RESULTS: In 511 patients (91.25%) we registered the first stage of the disease, in 42 (7.50%) the second stage and in 7 (1.25%) the third stage of the disease. The mean age of patients with erythema migranes was 38.67 years, mean incubation period was 9.37 days, and tick was removed from the skin after 2.29 days on average. Most of the identified tick bites originated from suburban areas (50.29%), they predominantly occurred in May and June (63.01%), and most of the ticks were removed improperly (57.67%). Dominant clinical manifestations of the second stage were acute meningitis (9.52%), Bannwarth's syndrome (9.52%), arthralgia and arthritis (50%), skin lesions (14.28%), cardiac disorders (11.90%) and mild liver lesions (2.38%) and generalized lymphadenopathy (2.38%). Chronic neuroborreliosis (42.85%), acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (28.57%) and chronic arthritis were dominant clinical manifestations of the third stage. Up to 81.63% of patients with late stage of disease had a history of previous tick bite. One third of patients were asymptomatic in the first stage of the disease. Improper treatment of the first stage resulted in development of late stage disease in 57.14% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Morbidity of Lyme disease in Vojvodina is about 1.98-9.8 cases on 100.000 inhabitants, and it belongs to regions with low incidence. Majority of bites are registered during summer months arround cities. Longer persistence of vector on the skin is a risk factor for manifested diseases. Inappropriately treated or completely untreated persons have higher risk for disseminated infection. In our country, most common manifestations of the second stage are neurological and articular manifestations as in the third stage. Leading symptoms and epidemiology aren't enough for diagnosis of Lyme disease, and more specific and sensitive serologic assays are necessary.

AB  - A method of dissecting fully engorged female ticks to remove the brain tissue is described, together with a histochemical technique for demonstrating the presence of cholinesterase in the brain. The methods were used on acaricide susceptible females of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neum. from Entebbe, Uganda, to compare the in vivo effect of an organophosphate, chlorfenvinphos, with that of an organochlorine acaricide, toxaphene. Chlorfenvinphos completely suppressed cholinesterase in the brain, but toxaphene appeared not to do so.

AB  - Lyme disease (LD) is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, transferred by infected ticks Ixodus ricinus. LD occurs endemically in Europe, America and Northern regions of Asia. In Poland, LD is the most frequent tick borne disease, which causes serious epidemiological problems. The main health hazard of LD occurs on the forested areas of Podlasie, Maritime province, the West Poland lake district, and Carpathians. The highest incidence 114.0 per 100 000 was registered in Podlaskie province. The infectious cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi includes: nymph moulds to adult, eggs laid by female, eggs hatch to larva, larva feeds on first host, fully fed larva drops to ground, larva moulds to nymph, nymph attaches to and feeds on the second host. LD is a chronic disease attacking many organs, including the skin, heart, brain and joints. LD is divided into three stages based on clinical symptoms: I - limited infection (Erythema migrans and Borrelia lymphoma), II - disseminated infection (numerous erythema migrans, early neuro-borreliosis, joint inflammation, Lyme carditis), III - late borreliosis (chronic atrophic limbs inflammation, late neuroborreliosis, chronic joint inflammation). At present, the best diagnostic method for LD is a labor- and time consuming two-stage serological method. First-line antibiotics in the treatment of Lyme disease are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and penicillin G. The best method of avoiding Borrelia burgdorferi infection is to avoid biting from ticks carrying spirochetes. Early removal of ticks, protects against spirochaetal infection.

AB  - An account is given of experiments carried out in South Africa in 1948 and 1949 on the control of Amblyomma habmaeum Koch on cattle by weekly treatment with dips or sprays. The materials tested were BHC (benzene hexachloride), arsenic, a combination of the two and, as a spray, a combination of BHC and DDT. A. hebraeum is a three-host tick, and control is directed chiefly against the adults, though the larvae and nymphs attach to cattle to some extent. BHC was used as a suspension of dispersible powder or paste or as an emulsified solution, and, after each dipping in it, samples of fluid were taken for chemical analysis. They were analysed for total hydrolysable chlorine and the Y isomer content estimated on the basis that crude BHC contained 10 per cent. of it [ cf. R.A.E. B 37 209]. Biological tests of dipping and spraying fluid were also made by an in vitro technique [36 21]. The following is based on the authors' summary of the results. In the preliminary experiments, all treatments markedly reduced the numbers of male ticks on the cattle. Arsenic alone as a dip or spray and a dip of arsenic and BHC (50 parts gamma isomer per million) did not reduce the numbers of females, and 50 p.p.m. gamma BHC alone as a dip did so only slightly. Spraying with 50 p.p.m. gamma BHC, however, was encouraging, and dipping in 100 p.p.m. was also satisfactory. The relative ineffectiveness of dipping was attributable to loss of activity of BHC in the dipping tanks through pollution. This makes chemical determination of dips based on total hydrolysable chlorine of little value unless it is correlated with a biological test. The results of the preliminary experiments were largely confirmed by those of the second series. Males always outnumbered females in collections where the ticks were removed from cattle weekly. On untreated cattle on which infestations were allowed to accumulate, males increased week by week and eventually greatly outnumbered females. This suggests that males remained on the hosts longer, and were recorded more than once in the consecutive counts. The arsenic spray did not reduce numbers of females or prevent them from engorging, but few females removed from treated cattle oviposited and those that did so laid sterile eggs, whereas females in a similar state of engorgement removed from untreated animals laid fertile eggs. All BHC treatments appeared more effective than arsenic, spraying again being more effective than dipping. The addition of 0.03 per cent. copper sulfate in a BHC dip did not prevent the loss of biological activity. When the BHC was in an emulsion concentrate, the dips were kept at the desired concentration and biologically active by adding fresh dip each week. Under these conditions, both dips and sprays were satisfactory when used at 100 p.p.m. gamma isomer. Less was not adequate and a combination of 50 p.p.m. gamma isomer and arsenic used as a dip was not satisfactory and little better than the 50 p.p.m. gamma BHC alone as a spray. Sprays made from a dispersible powder diluted to contain 50 p.p.m. gamma BHC and 0.1 per cent. p, p'DDT gave striking results, reducing the weekly counts of ticks to below the number removed each week from an untreated control group and very much below those on cattle on which the ticks were allowed to accumulate. This might be due to persistent action or repellent effect.

AB  - Background: The common tick Ixodes ricinus is the main vector in Europe of the tick-borne encephalitis virus and of several species of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, which are the etiological agents of Lyme borreliosis. The risk to contract bites of I. ricinus is dependent on many factors including the behaviour of both ticks and people. The tick's site of attachment on the human body and the duration of tick attachment may be of clinical importance. Data on I. ricinus ticks, which were found attached to the skin of people, were analysed regarding potentially stage-specific differences in location of attachment sites, duration of tick attachment (= feeding duration), seasonal and geographical distribution of tick infestation in relation to age and gender of the tick-infested hosts. Methods. During 2008-2009, 1770 tick-bitten persons from Sweden and the Åland Islands removed 2110 I. ricinus ticks. Participants provided information about the date of tick detection and location on their body of each attached tick. Ticks were identified to species and developmental stage. The feeding duration of each nymph and adult female tick was microscopically estimated based on the scutal and the coxal index. Results: In 2008, participants were tick-bitten from mid-May to mid-October and in 2009 from early April to early November. The infestation pattern of the nymphs was bimodal whereas that of the adult female ticks was unimodal with a peak in late summer. Tick attachment site on the human body was associated with stage of the tick and gender of the human host. Site of attachment seemed to influence the duration of tick feeding. Overall, 63% of nymphs and adult female ticks were detected and removed more than 24 hours after attachment. Older persons, compared to younger ones, and men, compared to women, removed "their" ticks after a longer period of tick attachment. Conclusions: The infestation behaviour of the different tick stages concerning where on the host's body the ticks generally will attach and when such ticks generally will be detected and removed in relation to host age and gender, should be of value for the development of prophylactic methods against tick infestation and to provide relevant advice to people on how to avoid or reduce the risk of tick infestation. © 2013 Wilhelmsson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Sampling difficulties, overlapping generations and inaccessibility make it difficult to observe the life-cycle of Dermacentor andersoni Stiles in nature. In this paper, descriptions are given of two methods of rearing that facilitated study of the biology of the tick as well as providing a means of mass-producing adults for experimental use. The smaller installation consisted of two runways at floor level, each with its own nest-box and food-box, inside an insectary with an 11X12 ft earth floor and fly-screen roof and walls. The nest-boxes were protected from rain. One runway was stocked with a pack rat ( Neotoma cinerea) and the other with two mantled ground squirrels ( Spermophilus lateralis), and, for seven weeks only, two white-footed mice ( Peromyscus) and two white mice were put near the runways in wire-mesh sleeves. Engorged female ticks were placed in gauze cylinders, which were opened when eggs began to hatch, sunk into the earth near the runways. Some engorged larvae and nymphs were also exposed in cylinders. The second installation had 24 combinations of runway and nest-box distributed regularly over a field measuring 80X18 yd and was used to provide information on the relative yield of ticks from six species of rodents that occur in the habitat of D. andersoni in British Columbia and as a means of studying methods of mass-producing field-reared ticks. Removable wooden covers were used instead of feeding-boxes. Larvae were introduced directly into the runways. Two other rearing methods, which are not described, were also used. Earlier workers had reported that the life-cycle of D. andersoni, for which the name D. venustus Banks was then used, was seldom or never completed in one year [ RAE B 3 95; 5 80; 16 137], but in the author's studies, which lasted from 1962 to 1967, both one-year and two-year cycles were observed, depending on the date on which the larvae hatched or were put out. On rodents infested with larvae in June, large numbers of adults were produced in the following year, but when larvae were put out in mid-August no adults were produced in the next year but large numbers in the one after. It is suggested that photoperiod contributes to the differences in behaviour involved. Each year, adult ticks wandered on and near the soil surface in the autumn but did not seek hosts or climb up grass stems to questing positions until spring. A tendency for the adults to congregate southwards of the point of dropping of the engorged nymphs was discernible. Adult ticks that were transferred to sheep in mid-December fed in one trial, but they remained inactive when left undisturbed because soil temperatures under the snow were usually about 0°C and activity does not begin until about 5°C. The cycles observed in the experimental quarters and field collections indicate that both one-year and two-year cycles occur in southern British Columbia at an altitude of about 1, 000 ft. A three-year cycle with overwintering larvae may occur at higher altitudes and latitudes. About 10% of ticks marked in their first year of activity in 1964 were active the next spring. Feeding by female ticks from both one-year and two-year cycles caused paralysis in lambs. Records of general collecting in British Columbia from 1929 to 1967 showed that larvae had been found from early May to early December, with a peak in July, and nymphs from late March to early October, with a peak in July-August. In a comparison of the tick-yield of Marmota flaviventris, S. lateralis, S. columbianus, N. cinerea, Eutamias amoenus and P. maniculatus, by far the largest number of adult ticks was produced on M. flaviventris, but, on the basis of ticks per net weight of rodent, the results were more uniform.

AB  - Attachment by ticks to ocular surfaces is uncommon, but has been reported. The objective of this article is to describe a case of conjunctival tick attachment and a method for removal by conjunctival excision. A 39-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a complaint of foreign-body sensation in his right eye. He was found to have a live tick embedded in his conjunctiva. The tick was removed en bloc with surrounding conjunctiva by an ophthalmologist. The arthropod was identified as the larval stage of the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). The patient did not experience any systemic illnesses or adverse sequelae. Attachment of ticks to the conjunctiva is unlikely to result in disease transmission when the larval stage is involved. However, removal by excision of a surrounding block of conjunctiva is recommended to ensure complete removal of all tick body parts. Copyright 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Red deer ( Cervus elaphus) is one of the most important host of the adult tick ( Ixodes ricinus) which is the basic vector of the Lyme disease causative agent - Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in Europe. The aim of the present study was to establish the role of red deer in the transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l. Material and methods. Tissues from 74 red deers were evaluated and the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l DNA was identified using nested PCR technique based on fla gene. The identification of species belonging to B. burgdorferi s.l complex was performed after restriction digestion of nested PCR product with DdeI enzyme and sequencing of nested PCR product. The study included also 55 isolates of I. ricinus females removed from red deer and 466 ticks (73 adult and 393 nymphs) collected from the vegetation in the area where the red deer lives. Results. There were no DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l complex in the red deer tissues and in ticks removed from deer, however in one tick removed from deer the DNA of other Borrelia species - B. miyamotoi was identified. In ticks collected from vegetation 3 species belonging to B. burgdorferi s.l. complex were identified: B. garinii (3.2% ticks studied), B. afzelii (6.9%) and B. valaisiana (3.6%), however DNA of B. miyamotoi was absent. These results confirm inability of survival of B. burgdorferi s.l. species in tick I. ricinus feeding on red deer blood. However there is a possibility of survival of B. miyamotoi in presence of deer blood at least in ticks feeding on red deer. The main role of red deer in keeping the constant infection level of B. burgdorferi s.l. in the whole population of I. ricinus ticks does not concern B. miyamotoi.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis, the most common tick-borne disease in both North America and Europe, is acquired through the bite of certain tick species in the genus Ixodes. The number of Ixodes ticks in the environment can be reduced by relatively simple interventions such as removing leaf litter and brush, which increases exposure of the tick to sun and air and takes advantage of the tick's vulnerability to desiccation, or by application of acaricides to property. Deer elimination or exclusion, application of topical acaricides to mice or deer, and application of systemic acaricides to deer are more complex approaches. However, none of these methods for reducing tick numbers, nor any of the recommended personal prevention measures, such as reducing the amount of exposed skin, use of tick repellents on exposed skin or clothing, and frequent tick checks to remove attached ticks expeditiously, has been demonstrated to decrease significantly the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in humans. Only two strategies have been shown to do so. A recombinant outer surface protein A (OspA) vaccine was approximately 80% effective in clinical trials in the United States, and a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours of an I. scapularis tick bite, was shown to be 87% effective. The OspA vaccine is no longer manufactured due to poor sales. Consequently, single-dose doxycycline prophylaxis is rapidly gaining acceptance in the United States. Limiting single-dose doxycycline to just the highest risk tick bites can be accomplished if the health care provider has learned to differentiate engorged from unengorged I. scapularis ticks. Limitations of single-dose doxycycline prophylaxis are that the majority of patients with Lyme borreliosis do not recall a tick bite, and that there is no evidence that other Ixodes transmitted infections, such as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, would be prevented. A safe, effective, inexpensive and well-accepted vaccine would be welcome. [References: 87]

AB  - Tick bites and prophylaxis. The best currently available method for preventing infection with Borrelia burgdorferi is to avoid vector tick exposure. If exposure to Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificus ticks is unavoidable, measures recommended to reduce the risk of infection include using both protective clothing and tick repellents, checking the entire body for ticks daily, and promptly removing attached ticks, before transmission of B. burgdorferi can occur (A-III [see tables 1 and 2 for recommendation categories, indicated in parentheses throughout this text]). Routine use of either antimicrobial prophylaxis (E-I) or serological tests (D-III) after a tick bite is not recommended. Some experts recommend antibiotic therapy for patients bitten by I. scapularis ticks that are estimated to have been attached for >48 h (on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood), in conjunction with epidemiological information regarding the prevalence of tick-transmitted infection (C-III). However, accurate determinations of species of tick and degree of engorgement are not routinely possible, and data are insufficient to demonstrate efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in this setting. Persons who remove attached ticks should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of tick-borne diseases for up to 30 days and specifically for the occurrence of a skin lesion at the site of the tick bite (which may suggest Lyme disease) or a temperature >38(degrees)C (which may suggest human granulocytic ehrlichiosis [HGE] or babesiosis). Persons who develop a skin lesion or other illness within 1 month after removing an attached tick should promptly seek medical attention for assessment of the possibility of having acquired a tick-borne disease (A-II). Health care practitioners, particularly those in areas where Lyme disease is endemic, should become familiar with its clinical manifestations, recommended practices for testing for it, and therapy for the disease, as well as for HGE and babesiosis (A-III). Testing of ticks for tick-borne infectious organisms is not recommended, except in research studies (D-III). Prior vaccination with the recently licensed recombinant outer-surface protein A (OspA) vaccine preparation reduces the risk of developing Lyme disease associated with tick bites but should not alter the above recommendations (A-I). Early Lyme disease. Administration of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) or amoxicillin (500 mg 3 times daily) for 14-21 days is recommended for treatment of early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of neurological involvement or third-degree atrioventricular heart block (A-I). In prospective studies, these agents have been shown to be effective in treating erythema migrans and associated symptoms. Doxycycline has the advantage of being efficacious for treatment of HGE, which may occur simultaneously with early Lyme disease. Doxycycline is relatively contraindicated during pregnancy or lactation and for children aged <8 years. Because of its higher cost, cefuroxime axetil (500 mg orally twice daily), which is as effective as doxycycline in the treatment of erythema migrans (A-I), should be reserved as an alternative agent for those patients who can take neither doxycycline nor amoxicillin. For children, we recommend amoxicillin at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/d, divided into 3 doses per day (maximum, 500 mg/dose), or doxycycline (for those aged (greater-than or equal to)8 years) at a dosage of 1-2 mg/kg twice per day (maximum, 100 mg/dose) (B-II). Cefuroxime axetil, at a dosage of 30 mg/kg/d, divided into 2 doses daily (maximum, 500 mg/dose), is an acceptable alternative agent (B-III). Macrolide antibiotics are not recommended as first-line therapy for early Lyme disease (E-I). When used, they should be reserved for patients who are intolerant of amoxicillin, doxycycline, and cefuroxime axetil. Possible regimens for adults are as follows: azithromycin, 500 mg orally daily for 7-10 days; erythromycin, 500 mg orally 4 times daily for 14-21 days; and clarithromycin, 500 mg orally twice daily for 14-21 days. Possible dosages for children are the following: azithromycin, 10 mg/kg/d (maximum, 500 mg/d); erythromycin, 12.5 mg/kg 4 times daily (maximum, 500 mg/dose); and clarithromycin, 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (maximum, 500 mg/dose). Patients treated with macrolides should be closely followed. Ceftriaxone (2 g iv daily), although effective, is not superior to oral agents and is not recommended as a first-line agent for treatment of Lyme disease in the absence of neurological involvement or third-degree atrioventricular heart block (E-I). The use of ceftriaxone (2 g once daily iv for 14-28 days) in early Lyme disease is recommended for acute neurological disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy (B-II). Intravenous penicillin G at a dosage of 18-24 million units daily, divided into doses given every 4 h (for patients with normal renal function), may be a satisfactory alternative (B-II). Cefotaxime (2 g iv every 8 h) may also be a satisfactory alternative (B-II). For adult patients who are intolerant of both penicillin and cephalosporins, doxycycline (200-400 mg/d) in 2 divided doses given orally (or iv if the patient is unable to take oral medications) for 14-28 days may be adequate (B-II). For children, we recommend ceftriaxone (75-100 mg/kg/d) in a single daily iv dose (maximum, 2 g) (B-II) or cefotaxime (150-200 mg/kg/d) divided into 3 or 4 iv doses (maximum, 6 g/d) (B-III) for 14-28 days. An alternative is iv penicillin G (200,000-400,000 units/kg/d; maximum, 18-24 million units/d) divided into doses given every 4 h for those with normal renal function (B-II). Patients with first- or second-degree atrioventricular heart block associated with early Lyme disease should be treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as patients with erythema migrans without carditis (see paragraphs 1 and 2 of the recommendations in this section, above) (B-III). We recommend that patients with third-degree atrioventricular heart block be treated with parenteral antibiotics such as ceftriaxone (see paragraphs 5 and 6 of the recommendations in this section, above) in the hospital, although there are no clinical trials to support this recommendation (B-III). A temporary pacemaker may also be required. Although antibiotic treatment does not hasten the resolution of seventh-cranial-nerve palsy associated with B. burgdorferi infection, antibiotics should be given to prevent further sequelae (B-II). There was disagreement among panel members on the neurological evaluation of patients with seventh-cranial-nerve palsy. Some members perform a CSF examination on all patients with seventh-cranial-nerve palsy, whereas others reserve lumbar puncture for patients for whom there is strong clinical suspicion of CNS involvement (e.g., severe headache or nuchal rigidity). Patients whose CSF examinations yield normal findings may be treated with the same regimens used for patients with erythema migrans (B-III), whereas patients for whom there is clinical and laboratory evidence of CNS involvement should be treated with regimens effective against meningitis (see paragraphs 5 and 6 of the recommendations in this section, above) (B-II). Treatment for pregnant patients can be identical to that for nonpregnant patients with the same disease manifestation, except that tetracyclines should be avoided (B-III). Lyme arthritis. Lyme arthritis usually can be treated successfully with antimicrobial agents administered orally or intravenously. Administration of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily orally) or amoxicillin (500 mg 3 times daily), in each instance for 28 days, is recommended for patients without clinically evident neurological disease (B-II). For children, we recommend administration of doxycycline (1-2 mg/kg twice per day; maximum, 100 mg/dose), which can be given to patients aged (greater-than or equal to)8 years, or amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d, divided into 3 doses per day; maximum, 500 mg/dose) for 28 days (B-II). Oral therapy is easier to administer than iv antibiotics, is associated with fewer serious complications, and is considerably less expensive. Its disadvantage is that some patients treated with oral agents have subsequently manifested overt neuroborreliosis, which may require iv therapy for successful treatment. Further controlled trials are needed to compare oral with iv therapy. Neurological evaluation, including lumbar puncture, should be done for patients if there is a strong clinical suspicion of neurological involvement, Patients with both arthritis and objective evidence of neurological disease should receive iv ceftriaxone (2 g once daily for 14-28 days) (A-II). Alternative therapies include iv cefotaxime (2 g iv every 8 h) (B-III) or iv penicillin G (18-24 million units daily, divided into doses given every 4 h for patients with normal renal function) (B-lI). Because of low blood levels, the long-acting benzathine preparation of penicillin is not recommended (D-III). For children, we recommend administration of ceftriaxone (75-100 mg/kg/d in a single daily iv dose; maximum, 2 g) (B-III) or cefotaxime (150-200 mg/kg/d divided into 3 or 4 iv doses; maximum, 6 g/d) (B-III) for 14-28 days. An alternative is iv penicillin G (200,000-400,000 units/kg/d; maximum, 18-24 million units/d), divided into doses given every 4 h for those with normal renal function (B-III).

AB  - The duration of tick attachment is one factor associated with risk for human infection caused by several tick-borne pathogens. We measured tick engorgement indices at known time intervals after tick attachment and used these indices to determine the length of time that ticks were attached to tick-bite victims in selected Rhode Island and Pennsylvania communities where the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis occur. The total body length and width as well as the length and width of the scutum were measured on nymphal and adult female Ixodes scapularis Say removed from laboratory animals at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h after their attachment. Three engorgement indices were calculated at each time interval. In addition, engorgement indices measurements were recorded for 504 ticks submitted to a commercial laboratory for pathogen detection testing between 1990 and 1992. No detectable change was observed in the average engorgement indices for either nymphal or adult ticks between 0 and 24 h of attachment using any of the engorgement indices. After 24 h of tick attachment, all engorgement indices continuously increased: average indices for nymphs attached 36, 48, and 60 h were significantly different from those attached < or = 24 h and from each other. Similarly, average engorgement indices for adult ticks attached < or = 36 h were significantly different from those attached for 48 h or more. More than 60% of tick-bite victims removed adult ticks by 36 h of attachment, but only 10% found and removed the smaller nymphal ticks within the first 24 h of tick feeding. The duration of tick attachment may serve as a useful predictor of risk for acquiring various infections, such as Lyme disease and babesiosis, transmitted by I. scapularis. Regression equations developed herein correlate tick engorgement indices with duration of feeding. A table containing specific engorgement index prediction intervals calculated for both nymphs and adults will allow the practitioner or clinical laboratory to use easily measured tick engorgement indices to predict transmission risk by determining the duration of feeding by individual ticks.

AB  - A steer was infected with T. mutans (Aitong) by application of infected A. variegatum nymphs. Uninfected tick larvae were applied to this steer when piroplasms developed. The resultant nymphs were applied to the ears of rabbits. Equal numbers of ticks were removed daily from the rabbits and ground in Eagle's minimum essential medium. The infectivity of the supernatant fluid was tested in cattle. Infectivity was demonstrated from the 3rd to 7th days but not earlier. The feeding of A. variegatum in cattle and rabbits was compared. The increase of haemoglobin in the supernatant was correlated with the weight increase of the nymphs. It is hoped that an infective stabilate can be derived from ticks by this method.

AB  - Adults of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neum. infected as nymphs by feeding them on an African buffalo harbouring Theileria lawrencei, were applied to the ears of rabbits. Equal numbers of the feeding ticks were removed daily from rabbits and either dissected and processed so that parasites in their salivary glands could be examined morphologically and classified, or ground in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium, to harvest parasites from the ticks in the resultant supernatant fluid. The infectivity of the supernatant fluid was tested by inoculation of aliquots into groups of susceptible cattle. It was found that supernatant fluids produced from ticks fed for 0-2 days were uninfective to cattle but those produced from ticks fed for 3 to 9 days were infective. The most infective supernatant fluid was produced from ticks fed for 6 days. The reactions in cattle were correlated with the number and morphology of the parasites in sections of the tick salivary glands, and it was found that when mature parasites were present in the glands the supernatant fluid was infective to cattle. From the reactions in cattle inoculated with supernatant fluids from ticks fed for 5 or 6 days, it was concluded that this method of harvesting parasites was efficient. Examination of the salivary glands of a representative sample of ticks infected with T. lawrencei is a potential means of screening material for stabilates of T. lawrencei.<new para>ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:<new para>Nymphs of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus were infected with Theileria lawrencei by feeding on an infected African buffalo and when the ticks became adult they were applied to the ears of rabbits. Supernatant fluids from adult ticks fed from days 0 to 2 were not infective to cattle; but ticks fed from days 3 to 9 were infective, maximum at 6 days. The infectivity was correlated with the development of morphologically mature parasites in the salivary glands of the feeding ticks.

AB  - A method for rapid species identification of ticks may help clinicians predict the disease outcomes of patients with tick bites and may inform the decision as to whether to administer postexposure prophylactic antibiotic treatment. We aimed to establish a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) spectrum database based on the analysis of the legs of six tick vectors: Amblyomma variegatum, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Hyalomma marginatum rufipes, Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, and Dermacentor reticulatus. A blind test was performed on a trial set of ticks to identify specimens of each species. Subsequently, we used MALDI-TOF MS to identify ticks obtained from the wild or removed from patients. The latter tick samples were also identified by 12S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing and were tested for bacterial infections. Ticks obtained from the wild or removed from patients ( R. sanguineus, I. ricinus, and D. marginatus) were accurately identified using MALDI-TOF MS, with the exception of those ticks for which no spectra were available in the database. Furthermore, one damaged specimen was correctly identified as I. ricinus, a vector of Lyme disease, using MALDI-TOF MS only. Six of the 14 ticks removed from patients were found to be infected by pathogens that included Rickettsia, Anaplasma, and Borrelia spp. MALDI-TOF MS appears to be an effective tool for the rapid identification of tick vectors that requires no previous expertise in tick identification. The benefits for clinicians include the more targeted surveillance of patients for symptoms of potentially transmitted diseases and the ability to make more informed decisions as to whether to administer postexposure prophylactic treatment.

AB  - The vectorial competence of the tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus is discussed in relation to the epidemiology of canine visceral leishmaniasis, taking into account its strict association with dogs and the low indices of natural infection presented by its known vector, the phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania chagasi and the infectivity of these parasites in the tick, 39 specimens (6 females, 11 males and 22 nymphs) of R. sanguineus were removed from 21 dogs showing diverse symptoms of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL). Six ticks (15.4%) gave positive results for the genus Leishmania using the PCR technique. To determine the infectivity of the parasites, 36 hamsters were inoculated orally and peritoneally with macerates of ticks removed from nine dogs symptomatic for visceral leishmaniasis. After 6 months the hamsters were sacrificed and necropsied. Serum was removed for IFAT, as well as spleen and liver fragments to make imprint smears and for PCR. Eight (88.9%) of these dogs presented ticks that were infective for 14 hamsters (41.2%), 12 (85.7%) of them infected peritoneally and two (14.3%) orally. PCR revealed 27 smears (40.9%) to be positive, 20 (62.5%) of them infected peritoneally and seven (20.6%) orally. IFAT showed 14 positive animals (41.2%). Based on these findings, we suggest that the vectorial capacity of R. sanguineus for L. chagasi should be evaluated further, opening new perspectives in the epidemiology of ZVL. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This short communication compares the use of a tick removal device (with a slit for tick prehension and rotation) with surgical forceps, in the hands of a trained operator (a veterinarian). In addition, the report compares three commercial tick removal devices that use different methods of tick prehension and removal, in the hands of pet owners. A total of 46 cats and 178 dogs with tick infestation brought to 18 participating veterinary clinics in eastern France between April 2001 and May 2002 were included in the study. Four different tick removal devices that work in different ways were assessed: a surgical forceps (Adson forceps) with straight, very sharp jaws (a device that uses apposing jaws and traction (AT)); Pen-Tweezers (Buster) (a device that uses apposing jaws and rotation (AR)); Pro-Tick Remedy (SCS) (a device that uses a slit and traction (ST)) and Crochet O'Tom (H3D) (a device that uses a slit and rotation (SR)). Comparison of the SR device and the AT device used by a veterinarian demonstrated that the SR device was significantly quicker for removal of tick (P<0.05), was easier to use to grab the tick (P<0.05), required less force for extraction (P<0.01) and caused less damage to the mouthparts of the tick (P<0.01). There were no significant differences between the two devices in terms of success or failure of removal. Comparison of the three commercial devices used by pet owners revealed no significant differences in terms of success or failure of tick removal. However, the SR device was significantly better than one or both of the other two devices for the time required to remove the tick (P<0.005), the ease with which the tick was grabbed (P<0.05), the force needed to extract the tick (P<0.001), the reaction of the animal (P<0.05) and the condition of the tick's mouthparts (P<0.01). No significant differences were found between devices in terms of the ease with which the tick was held in the device. Both the veterinarians and pet owners expressed preference for the commercially available SR device. Based on these findings, prehension of tick by use of a slit device that avoids excertion of pressure on the body of the tick is recommended. The SR device appears to be a little easier to use than the ST device; its simplicity in the hands of the pet owner is an additional feature in its favour.
